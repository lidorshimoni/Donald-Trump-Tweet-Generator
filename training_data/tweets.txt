obama just said mittromney was a very successful investor big mistake for obama to admit he has less and less credibility
obama is looking rhetorical and weak mittromney is looking strong and sharp
obama weak on immigration all words no action hes been prez years
obama keeps namedropping bill clinton he is no bill clinton
mittromney much better on libya and middle east problems obama has no answer
such long rhetorical and boring answers from obama no wonder nothing gets done
you talk tough mr president but have done nothing about china killing our jobs and economy
debate showed these guys really hate each other at one point it looked like they would come to blows
george will said best debate he ever saw if you ever heard george will speakboring anything is exciting
stupid george will gave mittromney no chance months ago take off his little spectacles and hes just another dummy
verlander pitched great but yankees look truly defeated
at the debate the president kept talking of what he is going to do i kept saying why didnt he do it he lost me a long time ago
remember i said derek dont sell your trump world tower apartmentits been lucky for you the day after he sold it he broke his foot
i still love derek he is a winner
obama has zero credibility on oil and coal if we do not win energy as a country we just do not win period
do you believe barack hussein obama aka barry soetoro looked like a president last night i dont
obama did much better than he did last timebut still lost decisively
polls are starting to look really bad for obama looks like hell have to start a war or major conflict to win dont put it past him
my twitter has become so powerful that i can actually make my enemies tell the truth
my twitter followers will soon be over million all the biggies its like having your own newspaper
marileenelson thanks
really enjoyed discussing yankees yesterday with realmicihaelkay i am a long time yankee fan
wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds they are killing the finances environment of many countries communities
remember new environment friendly lightbulbs can cause cancer be careful the idiots who came up with this stuff dont care
robert bryce nypostcongrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines how destructive they are windmills are a disaster
if obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically environmentally aesthetically
all the guys that said mittromney would lose are rapidly coming on board mitt will remember the early helpers
obama was beaten but not knocked out he lives to fight another day but in the real world presidents are not given a second chance
bad decisions can be devastating
mittromney scored last night on both substance and style
obama at big debate disadvantagehe just cant get away from his bad record
obama talks about what he is going to dowhy the hell didnt he just do it especially in the first years when he had all votes necessary
george steinbrenner yankees would have gotten out of arods contract three years agobut put arod in tonight
cc is a great pitcher and can handle pressure yankees will win tonight so far my predictions have all been correct

initial reports say debate viewership dropped see what happens when i am not mentioned
michael vick of the philadelphia eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback
robert pattinson should not take back kristen stewart she cheated on him like a dog will do it againjust watch he can do much better
can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight
what is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all we should be given credit for taking this risk
mystikangel bring johnrich back he is back
i find it very sad that we have a president with zero private sector experience attacking an opponent for being successful
if obama goes after mitts private sector experience in the next debate then mitt should ask for obamas college recordsall of them
mitts proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth
re libyahillary took the blame for obama
obamas spending and borrowing is burying america and destroying our childrens future does he even care
when were talking about math that doesnt add up how about trillion of deficits over the last four years mittromney

bad sign for obamas campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on states their internals must be horrendous
when strasburg leaves nationals for another team for more money will washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good
clinton commented in ohio today that mittromney is right the economy has not been fixed under obamai always said bill was an honest man

lots of autism and vaccine response stop these massive doses immediately go back to single spread out shots what do we have to lose

autism rates through the roofwhy doesnt the obama administration do something about doctorinflicted autism we lose nothing to try
toure when you are fired from msnbc for your bad ratings and racist coverage stop by and say hello
dont let obama play the iran card in order to start a war in order to get electedbe careful republicans
i wish tonights debate would cover more than foreign policy
had a great time watching the nyjets patriots game yesterday at gillette stadium great and exciting game
last week i had sinows tweet of the week and the most retweeted mittromney mention twice can anyone else top that dont think so
kennedymac dopey i never went bankrupt

dukepga kenthanksi am proud of you great job on tour this yeari always knew
larrylivermore dopey i never went bankrupt
obama planted that nytimes story on iran so it will be discussed in tonights debate he wants libya and china off the table
this is my last election after my election i have more flexibility obama to medvedevrussiae discussing our nuclear arsenal
obama is an easy target on foreign policy mittromney has many openings to attack especially when obama starts bragging about bin laden
everyone knows i am right that robert pattinson should dump kristen stewart in a couple of years he will thank me be smart robert
even though obama dumped the reverend like robert should dump kristin
bobschieffer will a great job tonighthe is a real pro and respected by both sides
everybody is asking about my announcement this wednesday concerning barack obamajust wait and see
i look forward to mittromney hitting obama hard tonight for lying about benghazi cia told obama it was a terrorist attack after hrs
why dont we ask the navy seals who killed bin laden they dont seem to be happy with obama claiming credit all he did is say ok
trottofficial thanksand doing great business from all over the world
brandonthrill thanksa great compliment
my good friends in connecticut have a great opportunity to send an amazing businesswoman to washington vote for lindamcmahon for senate
i have watched lindamcmahon for years she will bring jobs business back to connecticutincredible woman
well this is it the final debate lets see how it goes ill be tweeting live
bob schieffer will do a great job tonight always treated me fairly
mittromney looks much calmer and obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward
i will be doing squawkcnbc at
debate was somewhat hard to watch last night viewership will be way down
the debate was pretty even but i thought mitt should have been much more aggressive on obamas failed foreign policy and i mean much more
i always said that lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges by stopping he gave his enemies an opening
no matter what happens in the election davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit he has kept obama in it even with his terrible record
casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent from a directors point of view steven spielberg
lance armstrong fought for years then just ran out of energy very sad storyalthough they caught him red handedhe definitely cheated
when the military informed obama that they had bin laden is there anyone with a brain that would not have said ok go get him
mittromney should have been more aggressive last night yet some polls have him winning the debate
mitt romney must start congratulating the navy seals and military on bin killing not the president
china will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own
tomorrow i will be tweeting on only one subject
my announcement is tomorrow
barack obama said absolutely not times before he agreed to go after bin laden now he wants all of the credit
last night was the first time obama said we instead of i in respect to bin ladens killing
everyone is asking me to speak more on robert kristeni dont have time except to say robert drop her she cheated on you will again
bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night i only wish mitt was more aggressive
thank you to dailytelegraph reviewer neilmidgley who stated youve been trumped was so biased in favour of the protesters
that it was hard not to end up rooting for trump
bbc should never have played that piece of garbage documentary yet the phones are ringing off the hook to play the course
no wonder bbc is in such big trouble boss was just firedthey are lost
if you like having the world collapse and being told america is leading from behindvote obama
invincibility lies in the defence the possibility of victory in the attack sun tzu
story will be released today at noon est on twitter and facebook
all predictions re my oclock release are totally incorrect stay tuned
the response has been fantastic actually overwhelming thank you
my offer to obama is about transparency in american people were sold on hope and change this our last chance to get the full record
third rate politico took every negative tweet or response they could find put it outwhen in fact the response is incredibly positive
glad to hear seanhannity supports my offer to obama as sean says is an easy million to charity what does obama have to
i just learned that politico has no credibilitytotal phonies that dont report the truth a puppet of obama
i am happy to donate million to a charity barack obama chooses all i am asking is that he is transparent with the american people
obama has no problem leaking national security secrets why cant he release his records especially when is going to charity
by releasing his records he can come clean with the american people and have million go to a charity
in light the benghazi emails released last night it is apparent that obama has no problem lying to the american public
glad to hear north carolina is solid for mittromney it started trending for mitt solidly after my speech at the ncgop convention
just stated by a total pro you are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking

barbarajwalters theviewtv barbara unfortunately youve missed the entire point of my announcementyou just dont get it
barbarajwalters theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when i was right about rosie besides i get great ratings on the view
barbarajwalters theviewtvwhy did you choose me as one of the most fascinating people of the year last season and more than once
side needs donald anncoulter on show last night thanks ann
i am offering the chance for barack obama to redistribute to any charity of his choice everyone wins take the deal
marksanchez be too upset over evalongoria he will always do great
michellemalkin i fully supported mccain but when he lost hoped obama would be great for us he wasnt
what will be the response on wednesday if obama doesnt take the million dollars for charity
politico has really become a laughing stock of good political reporting
i hope derek recovery is going well he is a very special player and a great guy new york loves him yankees
for someone who demanded years of mitts tax returns you would think my offer to donate to charity for his records is an easy go
six days and counting until my offer to barack obama expires
doing david letterman lateshow tonight at nite of sweepsgoing into the lions den but ive been there many times before enjoy
it is really a shame that barack obama may stop from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent
the dealmaker is cunning secretive focused and never settles for less than he wants the america we deserve
letterman lateshow was great last night i had a lot of fun you could see his audience really wanted obama to take the for charity
lots of response that obama should give the to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in benghazi
another great charity that the could go to just a recommendation to the pres the wounded warriors represented so well by traceadkins
instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause
based on the ovation last night from the letterman lateshow audience i believe it will be hard for obama to throw down the drain
sabrinasiddiqui re taylor and conorgreat news for taylor
only because he has something to hide
ryanseven sounds like a good idea
lianneonlife i love the wounded warriorsobama should choose that as his charity
tylarreese thanks tylar
i hope so for the charitys sake
yewkalaylee great idea
i will soon start naming magazines that i think will foldi predicted newsweek

the election is still close but trending toward mittromney he leads all national polls and obamas likeability is imploding vote
be careful of an obama bomb to win election would be a horrible thing to do
obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester the middle east is a mess yet colin powell still endorses him wonder why
colin powell thought iraq has weapons of mass destruction
by the way where is oprah good question years ago she strongly supported obamanow she is silent anyway who cares i adore oprah
pretty audacious for obama to call mittromney a bser when he has lied about so much we dont have room to write
wheres the transparency despite obamas denial sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with jeremiah wright
my fellow tea party friends in ohiomake sure you take advantage of early voting so you can gotv election day know you can must win ohio
i have decided to add a caveat to my offer obama cant decide to send my to rev wright if he releases his records
barack obama has everything to gain why would anyone ever deny to charity
if my offer is refused every undecided oh voter will be fully aware that obama denied to charity all because he is hiding something
if obama doesnt accept my offer to be fully transparent what will he say
i hear they are very unhappy w arianna and huffingtonpost at aol bet she be there for long
the today show should call me about who to put on the i know more about people who get ratings than anyone
i want to end the day by saying there is no check i would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our president
i put donnydeutsch on apprentice at his request i did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my obama announcement
donnydeutsch tries so hard to be a star but he just doesnt have what it takesand he never will
alertthe president knew that the ambassador was being attacked in benghazi he did nothinghe is no leader
bernard mcguirk thanks for being so nice and defending me on oreillyyoure terrific

johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy but the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy fight on john
i am going to the nyjets game with the owner of the team a great guy
i defended starjonesesq when she lied about her stomach operation to lose weight only to get blindsided by her on the todayshow
a lot changed when david letterman said he was probably born in this country the word probably is a total disaster for obama
many people are saying that my challenge to obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers i agree
now grotesque bettemidler is into the trump act trying to become relevant again
i never liked bettemidlers persona or singing and havent heard her name in years
but whenever she sees me she kisses my ass shes disgusting bettemidler
bettemidler talks about my hair but im not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body so i wont is this a double standard
while bettemidler is an extremely unattractive woman i refuse to say that because i always insist on being politically correct
i guess billmaher saw my ratings on the lateshow the other night where letterman beat leno bill you are no letterman
im not hearing much from obama or his administration about my offer to charity or to which charity the money will go
dave letterman lateshow said during my interview that obama was probably born in the usthe word probably is a disaster for obama
obama lied about libya and the killingsemails are absolute he must release his records on wednesday and stop the lies
many people walked out on madonnas concert when she told them to vote for obama years ago i walked out because the concert was terrible

all weights are on cranes wrong side very precarious below move out
the water damage to nyc is amazing the winds were bad but the water was worse
i saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm
hurricane is good luck for obama again he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars
not only giving out money but obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real president dont fall for it
because of the hurricane i am extending my million dollar offer for president obamas favorite charity until on thursday
i am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap i would have been lambasted from coast to coast
dont let obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states
remember this obama wants to raise taxes mittromney wants to lower taxesneed i say more
neilmsdunn dopey few have built more than me
matthewlumby charity should get the money
the trump tower atrium is such a great place kept thousands of people warm safe during the stormthanks staff
the election is trending towards mittromney americans know we cant afford another years of the obama economic decline
these last years have not had a single quarter over gdp obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in american history
another great cause obama could send my donation to is a charity for first responders they are american heroes
i never fall for scams i am the only person who immediately walked out of my interview
without focus its just impossible to be successful at anything midas touch
how did obama go to a las vegas fundraiser on the day after he refused to send help to americans in benghazi
be honest if obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm then he would have been in ohio on monday
glad to hear that will be cohosting the grammy nominations special on taylor is terrific
digiphile redcross rt if you think presobama should release his records to get for charityfor red cross or another great charity
why does obama believe he shouldnt comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition hiding something
scary obama and the democrat senate have accrued over worth of debt without passing a budget in the last years more years
maybe obama should donate my to the families of the who have lost loved ones during the storm
fans shouldnt worry we have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming season of celebapprentice appropriately due to the storm
the polls momentum are trending towards mittromney dont let the hurricane change your thinking
not one trump building even those along the hudson river lost power a testament to quality systems and construction
the president has until tomorrow at noon to pick up for his favorite charity looking like he wont be doing it what is he hiding
im not hearing much from obama or his administration about my offer to charity or to which charity the money will go

congratulations kevin gabriel on your amazing article if i were a journalist this would be the next watergate and i would be a star
today barack obama is standing in water in nj remember on election day that he has put the us underwater
in the spirit of transparency obama should immediately release the tape of tyrone woods pleading for military support in benghazi
disneys acquisition of lucas film is a smart deal for both sides disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue
there is nothing i would be happier to do than to donate the to a charity of choice once he releases all of his records
a lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with lack of transparency i dont blame them
how does a dummy like billmaher get a television show his ratings stink youd think hbo could do a lot better

obama is a terrible negotiator he bails out chrysler and now chrysler wants to send all jeep manufacturing to chinaand will
president obama missed the deadline
i will soon be releasing my response to the fact that president obama refused to show his applications and records to the public
if i would have offered obama a billion dollars to show his records he would have refused
everybody knows why obama would not show his college applications they are just not willing to say
nice to see obama released a situation room photo from sandy how about releasing the photo taken during benghazi
what is your thought as to why obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications
how could obama leave those american heroes out to die in benghazi and he continues to lie to the public
i will start reviewing various political reporters etc websites as to their professionalism people asking for this
next year i will be changing the name of acre doral to trump national doral it will be the best resort in the is hot

the first ever allstar celebrity apprenticenbc premieres sunday march
congratulations to tom scocca and timothy burke of deadspin for exposing the manti fiasco
or mentally troubled or a con
not believable that manti was in love for one year with a girl he never met she then died he is either very stupid
can it just be new age that manti fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax
imo manti was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the heisman trophy
apologybrent musburger was a disgrace to broadcasting stop being so politically correct
brent musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking he is much more popular now than before
dumbass billmaher has still not given me the million he committed to charity we just presented him with a demand notice
billmaher needs to cut back on the pot and maybe he will stop making offers he afford
show is great for helping me get to sleep better than sominex
hbo should fire billmaher and bring back dennisdmz someone that is actually funny
ill bet lance armstrong wishes he didnt do the interview with oprah hes saying to himself what was i thinking
the interview with oprah will cause lance armstrong huge legal and financial problems sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide
boeing stock went way down because of so i just bought stock in boeing great company
all time hit leader pete rose should now be in the baseball hall of fame he has paid his penalty
katherinewebb thats shaquille oneals shoe
lance armstrong did himself great harm last night lawsuits failure will follow him
oprah was great amazing that she got lance armstrong to totally destroy his life why did he ever do that interview
the interview was great for oprah and terrible for lance armstrong
imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all very stupid
i still say teo did this in order to get sympathy for the heisman he did not win
alabama people are saying their team has real football real good for notre be back
deadspin guys are total had their story stolen right from under their bad media capitalized
dummies deadspin had their big payday taken from them by others in the media
deadspin will never make understand graciousness or best guy is leaving
disgusting response will teach me others not to be nice sad lesson

the worst negotiators in history otherwise known as republicans have just offered to suspend debt ceiling for four months pathetic
republicans are always worried about their general approval with proposing to ignore the debt ceiling they are ignoring their base
one positive from last week for lance was that everyone was focused on manti teo why did lance do that interview
the tea party delivered the house for gop so they could be fiscally responsible instead they have been irresponsible
has pres obama or the white house told the public what happened in algeria yet the media
happy anniversary to
yourself on your ability to find creative solutions to tough problems think big

big response to my tea party statementremember they were never fully energized by romney campaign and will have far more power with time
why didnt movie lincoln use fords theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater

it is a very effective commonly used business tool
people buy deals immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals
icahn kravis apollo most nobody says they went bankrupt
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool
speaker john boehner who i like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the republicans got absolutely nothing for it
the media is so in the tank for obama that it is funny thing is he stand them
so far he has been a complete failure at doing so he should read the art of the deal and use his energy to focus on a new career
an individual whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns has turned his attention to me

lord grant that i may always desire more than i can accomplish michelangelo

when employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group
i wonder if angelo has a job or is on assistance in any event im sure he is a nice guy

that was some episode last weekweve got a great cast
bret had a target on his back from the get go
theres definitely no love lost between piers and omarosa
trace and his team raised an amazing amount of looks like a good season for charities
omarosa always promises and delivers high drama
firing bret was a tough one for mebut omarosa doesnt seem to mind
will plan b miss trace
will team power be able to withstand omarosa as pm smooth sailing is not expected
my is incrediblei think the teams agree on that
which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment
honest omarosa she wont backstabshell come at you from the front
trace delivers check to hospital in nyc american red cross must be grateful to trace and his team for their tremendous work
what do you think of garys definition of fun
gary as the cat in the hat he can work it out
on the whole the teams seem to be working well together no warsyet
what latoya is saying omarosa is one of the nicest people shes met
next she says shes being set up by omarosa to failis somebody confused
thats an interesting talent that marilu possesses
omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept presentation
does anyone agree with marilu that gary while adorable is a distraction
re omarosa nasty tough or smartor all
which team is your favorite
its true dennis is really into thisvery animated i have never seen him this way before
re my hairshould i change it what do you think
the losing team is now back in boardroom i cant discuss the team members or whats going on or what happens from here on out

wilsonleeflores thanks wilson
thanks spence
you realize it or not your brand can be many times more valuable than your midas touch
be a yardstick of quality some people arent used to an environment where excellence is expected steve jobs
the ads made her look great and now she probably will run
ashley judds candidacy was created by karl roves terrible ads even before she thought seriously about running
if you love what you do you are going to work harder you are going to try harder and you will be better at it think big

in making any decision you need all the facts but after exhausting all due diligence in the end you have to go with your gut
according to new wpostabc poll obama has just lost points on public trust with economy
do your homework wasting other time due to poor planning and thoughtlessness will only leave a bad impression
have to have a good reason for doing what doing because people connect with the midas touch
kevconnorsespn great and good luck
celebrity apprentice will be rebroadcast tonight at on cnbc

tradergreg thanks
good move by msnbc in downgrading wegoted to a dead weekend spot this is truly a guy who shouldnt be on tv
i love watching dummy mcuban promote on ok show named shark he is just a small part of that show
when mcuban had his own show the benefactor it totally
cpac attendees fellow patriots lines for my cpacnews start at outside the potomac ballroom make sure to get there early
a reason partners stand him and on top of that the team sucks
those stupid people bought mcubans company of which he owned a piece
mcuban has less tv persona than any other person i can think of an arrogant crude dope who met some very stupid people
in the general course of human nature a power over a mans subsistence amounts to a power over his will alexander hamilton
when you think big you will automatically trigger more details because details are the major component of making anything big
the cpac speech went really well this morning first speaker standing ovation i really enjoyed it
press conference after cpac speech this morning was excellent lots of very professional reporters
i watched the last two minutes of the dallasmavs game last night i just loved watching them lose
he knows i respect him
boring failing rate political reporter jheil had flunky danamira write a totally false report about me today
jheil at nymag is such a pathetic reporter who want to know the truth a total obama flunky hack
dailycaller breitbartnews drudgereport gatewaypundit
for accurate reporting of my cpacnews speech read politicalticker newsmaxmedia politico huffpostpol
why cant the media tell the truth we would all be so much better off
i agreed to take the worst spot at cpac because nobody else wanted it and it was the only time i could be there it was great fun
realdonaldtrump chris matthews is happily smearing you on hardball poor chris i know chris wellhe is a lightweight

dennisrodman re omarosa is right becoming predictable
trump tower is open to the public

vattenfall the company behind a proposed asinine windfarm off the coast of aberdeen scotland is having serious financial difficulty
vattenfall ceo stated that the company needed to prepare itself for falling electricity demands in coming years a changing market
scotland will be so lucky if this monstrosity is not will tie them up in courts for years if necessary
dloesch played great audio from my cpacnews press conference on her radio show glad she made it
the blue monster is being torn up at trump doralresort on april i go out play it one more time until the new course opens
why does mcuban continue to embarrass the place dallasmavs with childish behavior really unprofessional
dallasmavs is against the western top four seeds after loss okcthunder swept the season series
sexual pervert deviant anthony weiner is polling to see if he can run for nyc mayor

realdonaldtrump mcuban hey donald whats the best confidence builder going against losers like mark cuban

golf match ive won club championships including this weekend mcuban swings like a little girl with no power or talent marks a loser
mcuban is very short off the tee and his basketball sucks also
jackvoices you are correct but he is so easy
bombings all over iraq todaythat country is falling apartsuch a horrible waste of lives and trillion dollars and i told you so

greenoliver mcuban is trumping the trumpster himself realdonaldtrump where do you live moron

ilpostio thats why ill never be pope
jibz true
beaumontanthony thanks anthony

sorry folks but donald trump is far richer and much better looking than dopey mcuban
why do shows have hispanic chair for the losing mccain huntsman a loser who deliver votes
does anyone remember the fight mcuban had w the was weak nonathlete trying to live life thru his players
one of the most obvious lessons on apprenticenbc is for the candidates to learn to think quickly think like a champion
rnc report was written by the ruling class of consultants who blew the election short on ideas just giving excuses to donors
amnesty is suicide for republicansnot one of those million who broke our laws will vote republicanobama is laughing at gop

why do the losers haters always say i wear a when they know i like it or not all ask barbara walters
it is very effective and a commonly used business tool
people buy deals immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals
icahn kravis apollo and most othersbut nobody says they went bankrupt
almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool
for the haters out of hundreds of deals or transactions i have used the bankruptcy laws times in order to cut better deals
but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage
haters stop saying i went bankrupt it is not so i never went bankrupt

the lincoln day dinner last night in michigan was fantastic record attendance and tremendous enthusiasm i loved it
circulation is way down and all he thinks about are his bad food restaurants condenastcorp
i cant believe vanityfair would renew graydon carters contract
graydon carter is laughing at the stupidity of chuck townsend on his contract renewal even he doesnt believe it condenastcorp
amazingly anthonyweiner is going to run the cure rate for his problem is lots of other things will come out
jodi arias jury is having a hard time with the death penaltyjudge just sent them back for further deliberatuon
newsmaxmedia is one of the top media outlets in the country chrisruddynmx has revolutionized political commentary and reporting
use adverse events and monumental challenges to make you strong think big
if the great si newhouse were still running condenastcorp he would fire graydon carter immediately circulation tanking
vanityfair could come back if graydon carter paid as much attention as he does to his bad food restaurants condenastcorp
pervert anthony wiener will never be able to get away from his perversionthe cure rate is zero

if the govt shuts down it is because obama wants to make working americans buy obamacare while businesses and govt are exempt
alexsalmond is making a truly stupid mistake by forcing ugly industrial wind turbines down throat hated for it

lightweight ag eric schneiderman who has been a total failure in office failed to report the approval rating of students for courses
why did failing ag eric schneiderman after years of looking file his pathetic lawsuit on a saturday afternoon unheard of no case
why is it that eric schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after jon corzine and big abusers for billions
why did lightweight ag eric schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions also recent asks
how can an attorney general ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case a total sleazebag
after years of long stops then starts why did dopey eric scheiderman tell people in the trump org this case is going awaywe have no case
what did our very stupid ineffective ag eric schneidean during his trips to my office tell me about president obama governor cuomo
realdonaldtrump just swat that nat out of the air and roll on donald sadly hes abusing the system
realdonaldtrump corzine is a evil schemer who stole billion trump starts a university to help people get rich hes bad
susanskeldon realdonaldtrump i wish there were more people in the world like you thanks for all you do your an awesome person thanks
robertlbuchsr realdonaldtrump mrtrump i just wanted u know i agree w urespect you

leavesofgrass realdonaldtrump actually i think it was factual and right on the mark you are a vulture sir nothing more thank you
jamieaydt one day i hope to be successful a bit controversial like realdonaldtrump keeping things interesting classy go for it
why would anyone think obama would attack syria the day of his speech in washington he doesnt want to detract from his press glory
i give the presidents speech a on the scale of to not bad but room for improvement
why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack syria why cant we just be quiet and if we attack at all catch them by surprise
that said the rich arab countries should get involved with the syrian mess not uswe should start rebuilding our own country military
realdonaldtrump a few billion more dollars but id rather say president trump than president gates
voicelikeariot realdonaldtrump washingtonpost why obama is giving up the element of surprise in syria perhaps because he is stupid
janusdcjavu realdonaldtrump the one who talks much does nothing except make billion dollars go get a job dumbass
no dopey i would not go into syria but if i did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools
i wonder what the great generals like patton the big m or robert e lee would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack
if we are going to continue to be stupid and go into syria watch russia as they say in the movies shoot first and talk later
let the arab league take care of syria why are these rich arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack
the united states needs to fix its own problems of which there are many first
tanjasworld tanjanever give up

realdonaldtrump bought a poster frame from my walmart store today and the sample picture was trump tower in chicago great
realdonaldtrump you should have your own talk show networks and many have asked but i dont have the time thanks
realdbp realdonaldtrump a talk show would be the perfect arena for you mr trump ratings would soar through the roof but no time
realdbp realdonaldtrump a talk show is a great idea please make the time sir the country needs you now more than ever
wcmartzofficial so true
joseczrs of course realdonaldtrump would be one of the few to publicly support miley cyrus racist behavior oh now shes a racist
ronhromadka realdonaldtrump talk shows are stale but a daily look at the inside wheeling and dealing of the trump org exciting
realdonaldtrump realdbp you could do it in your sleep and still make more sense than these other morons thanks

its not that im so smart its just that i stay with problems longer albert einstein
happy birthday deborah
the ratings of the cycle on msnbc a sad and pathetic show are way down if they fired racist moron toure a truly stupid guy they live
is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with syria our leaders dont know what they are doing
if obama attacks syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed he and the us will look very bad
how bad has our leader made us look on syria stay out of syria we dont have the leadership to win wars or even strategize
jenconservative realdonaldtrump not to mention we probably dont have the money to spend on another long war so true
onemikex realdonaldtrump hes to soft of a president incompetent would be a better word
leebandoni realdonaldtrump for once the uk has seen sense and not been dragged into this they were for once very smart
realdonaldtrump what would you do give a solution vs being so critical i would make america great again
realdonaldtrump jenconservative we need a strong minded potus in office before we enter into another war
jenconservative rkdrake realdonaldtrump i would be totally surprised if the us even has any money to spend on syria we dont
kingsfansouth realdonaldtrump i usually agree with you not tonight stop criticizing the presidenti will when he makes good decisions
realdonaldtrump the president of syria is killing people inhumanly but the so called rebels may be just as bad or worse
the president must get congressional approval before attacking syriabig mistake if he does not
for the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what when and where they will be doing in a future attack
syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our talk they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locationsamazing
who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes call it the plenty of notice war
obama now just wants to save face russia is now telling him dont do it he waited too long and the other side is much better prepared
china is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess they will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune laugh at us
be prepared there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into world war iii
realdonaldtrump im scared for my future you should be
realdonaldtrump cant say obama doesnt know how to throw a polite war general patton would not be happy right now
aveyahdoeswatch thank you
did anyone notice that obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us he couldnt even get britain no leadership
politixchick just from reading his tweets it seems like realdonaldtrump could run our country much better than our president right now
danconiapm realdonaldtrump hes no churchill he might not even be jimmy carter
dickquinn realdonaldtrump obviously amateur hour at the wh obama was unqualified when he ran and remains so

brandiharmon good luck
president obamas weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly in more ways than money attack on syria
realdonaldtrump you should be president save america thank you
akmackey so true
it is truly amateur hour at the white house and this is why we should not be doing the war thing right now
rickhuebner realdonaldtrump my son joey survived leukemia he is is now thank you makeawish and nccf for everything they did
imanthonyholmes ive always looked up to realdonaldtrump business and politics hes the man thank you
realdonaldtrump how would you treat the syria situation if president id let them all fight with each otherfocus on us
the arab league stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on syria but they want us to attackare our leaders insane or just stupid
why isnt the arab league paying for everything and sending troops they want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves
we have given syria so much time and informationthere has never been such an instance in wartime history syria is now fully prepared
why isnt realdonaldtrump president instead of obama that is truly a good question
realdonaldtrump you should be our next president this country would be in much better shape if you would have run in
libertybellskp realdonaldtrump thats the plan have you ever seen such a clueless leader in all your life i am stunned daily
in war the elememt of surprise is sooooo importantwhat the hell is obama doing

flljeff realdonaldtrump you always keep it realmr trumpthe truth hurts sometimes and america needs you to run in
realdonaldtrump your thoughts on bill de blasio for mayor i predicted two years ago that he would win
realdonaldtrump trump tower here in chicago is such an impressive building and architecturally really fits in with the area
our country is looking very bad right now
if the us attacks syria and hits the wrong targets killing civilians there will be worldwide hell to pay stay away and fix broken us
think of it the arab league doesnt want to get involved with syria but they want us to do their dirty work how stupid
realdonaldtrump but if we had a republican president you would say the exact opposite right wrong
trillblowa if the government just listened to realdonaldtrump this country would be so much better
president obamas arab spring is not looking so good right now
realdonaldtrump why the hell are you always criticising obama because he is doing a terrible in fact embarrassing job
china opec and russia laugh at us but now thanks to obama so does syria very sad
big key to winning is knowing where the other side is coming think like a champion
how can general martin dempsey tell obama that delaying the syria bombardment will have no consequences he is no patton or macarthur
thanks
perkinsholly great
your own brand yourself is the best way to go if you sell it who midas touch
realdonaldtrump mr trump for president thank you

battoulshamsi realdonaldtrump i just love ur way of thinking and analyzing things the pointthanks
bigsexybdavis realdonaldtrump mr trump would attack syria or no no lets make our country great again as they fight their war
the great generals macarthur and patton real leaders and fighters are spinning in their graves as we give syria info time to prepare
what i am saying is stay out of syria
for all of those fools that want to attack syria the ushas lost the vital element of surpriseso stupidcould be a disaster
realdonaldtrump you realize that is what iran wants dont you you beat iran in a much different fashionnot through syria
realdonaldtrump tannermarkboots just finished art of the deal brilliant insight into your mind thanks

walterdisneyusa realdonaldtrump you would make such a good president thank you
realdonaldtrump haha i love how you just tell like it is you arent who you are by not doing just that
president obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about syria crossing the red line amazingly now he denies he said that
the only reason president obama wants to attack syria is to save face over his very dumb red line statement do not attack syriafix usa
realdonaldtrump haha i love how you just tell like it is you arent who you are by not doing just that thank you
whoopsydoodle realdonaldtrump god your the best mr trump i like you tooooo
tell congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world make america great again
if you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the ny times of the rebels executing prisoners you would say forget the rebels
while everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack syria maybe we should knock the hell out of iran and their nuclear capabilities
gregfrech realdonaldtrump have you seen the video of the rebel commander cutting out and eating the syrian soldiers heart liver
again to our very foolish leader do not attack syria if you do many very bad things will happen from that fight the us gets nothing
i have just lost my beautiful elegant long time exec assistant norma foerderer she passed away yesterday a truly magnificent woman
it will be interesting to see what happens to eliot spitzer if he loses the election for comptroller to very capable scottmstringer
all former bush administration officials should have zero standing on syria iraq was a waste of blood treasure
russia is sending a fleet of ships to the mediterranean war in syria has the potential to widen into a worldwide conflict
you plan for the worst if you can live with the worst the good will always take care of the art of the deal
we should not attack syria but if they make the stupid move to do so the arab leaguewhose members are laughing at us should pay
jessegunplayjay realdonaldtrump youre a pussy shut up and stop crying jayleno show is funny no jay is dumb as a rockgets outplayed
the terrorists in syria are calling themselves rebels and getting away with it because our leaders are so completely stupid
khalidnasser realdonaldtrump in this case what would you do if you were the president id rebuild the us and make it great again
autumnallday realdonaldtrump i wish youd run for office the country needs more minds like yours thank you
reallltalk realdonaldtrump trump for president thanks
vindictivraider realdonaldtrump well quit yapping about and run for office i like your ideas do it
did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our president explaining what when and where to congress about a syrian attack far too late
we dont have the leadership including the generals who just said the element of surprise does not matter to attack anyone cool it
really bad news just announced concerning jobs far fewer jobs created in august than anticipated interest rates therefore to remain low
i wonder how much our leaders have promised or given russia in order for them to behave and not make the us look even worse
i am not angry at russia or china because their leaders are far smarter than ours we need real leadership and fastbefore it is too late
its sad that realdonaldtrump knows more about politics than our politicians
the golden rule of negotiating who has the gold makes the midas touch
the historic renovations at trumpdoral are moving on pace once complete trumpdoral will be south premiere resort
many of the syrian rebels are radical jihadi islamists who are murdering christians why would we ever fight with them
obama is not a leader hes just a campaigner
you want to know who you are dont ask act action will delineate and define thomas jefferson
political leader who face the future head on is putting the american dream at the america we deserve
garrygreiner realdonaldtrump we should send obama and congress to syria
when we have big disasters no one comes to our aid or even suggests helping but we are always expected to come to the aid of others
if syria was forced to use obamacare they would selfdestruct without a shot being fired obama should sell them that idea
bretbaier thx rt jedediahbila well done bretbaier thurs cable news ratings foxs bret baier beats cnn msnbc hln combined
just watching nbc news where our potential attack is being detailedthe exact ships the stealth bombers the destinationsso ridiculous
syria has been given so much time that much of the things we were going to bomb have been moved into civilian areas a polititians war
former president jimmy carter is so happy that he is no longer considered the worst president in the history of the united states
im a republican but not a fan of the last george bushhe also was a lousy president iraq etc in fact he was so bad he gave us obama
realdonaldtrump if only japan had the same courtesy dec they should have told us they were coming like us with syria

rlsteetle realdonaldtrump im addicted to your books are you writing another any time soon at some point there is so much to write
unabashedprog realdonaldtrump thegroveguru can you imagine serious people comparing modern warfare to a football game actually yes

does he look sharp smart and presidentialhis hands keep hitting the podium making a loud and distracting noisemicrophone too sensitive

doesnt want to remove assad worries what comes next
he is working hard and for that he must be given credit
we will have to see what russias next move will be they may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess
bottom line i dont think president changed peoples minds must hope for a lifeline from putin a very dangerous lifeline at that

many redstate democrats sticking with obama on deficit spending on the obamacare monstrosity will be defeated in
obama and the democrats have no respect for wwii vets trying to get into the memorial
obama administration had years to prepare for the obamacare rollout and of course they failed miserably
effort springs naturally from great pat riley
entrepreneurs do not realize that wealth does not come from work but from the assets they midas touch

standing strong for his people govwalker is ignoring the feds and keeping all wisconsin parks open great
government is shut down yet obama is now harassing the privately owned redskins to change its namehe needs to focus on his job
obama is tougher on wwii vets wanting to visit a dc memorial than iran he needs to show respect to our vets and not play games
of the government is still running during the shutdown while of nondefense federal workers are furloughed room for cuts
build too many walls and not enough isaac newton
with the debt limit approaching gop has even more leverage if they stay united and on message they can win
not allow fear to settle into place in any part of your life it is a defeating attitude a negative emotion think like a champion
my sense is that people are far angrier at the president than they are at congress re the interesting turn
mimilareina fogslifting realdonaldtrump redskins that will never fly theyd have to do the same for the chiefs braves indians ect
president should not be telling the washington redskins to change their nameour country has far bigger problems focus on themnot nonsense
president obama wants to change the name of the white house because it is highly discriminating and not at all politically correct
jeffanie thank you
bobbymayojr thanks
redskins true
thanks
expect the best from people they will rise to the challenge and its important to inspire confidence
if you are steadfast in your efforts and self respect critics will be harmless keep your focus

entrepreneurs who develop their midas touch do not work for money they work to create or acquire assets focus on assets
miss of the shots you dont wayne gretzky
i pay millions of a year to florida power light they give us what we want maybe a major class action suit against them

there are so many blatant lies coming out of the administration healthcare spying nsa irs brutally killed americans will it ever end
i just dont know why some of these nfl teams with lousy quarterbacks dont give tim tebow a chance what do they have to lose

if obama was willing to lie about obamacare then what else has he lied to us
china just called they want to lend obama another for the obamacare web site
never a loser until you quit mike ditka
obamacare is a disaster and snowden is a spy who should be executedbut if it and he could reveal obamas recordsi might become a major fan

evanmyers i love how many negative tweets realdonaldtrump gets he must look at them smile and go back to being a champion thank you
i would gain a whole new respect for president obama if he would say look we made a big mistake sorry no more lies or deception
revisionist history now obama claims he never told us that everyone could keep their healthcare plans crazy
can you believe that the builder of the failed obamacare website was just given a new government contract how stupid is that clueless
the truth is that we could have much better healthcare in our country at a much more affordable price everyone in us would benefit

use your intelligence and your education to execute what your imagination presents to you this is one step to becoming an entrepreneur
when obama tried to tweak his previous statement on obamacare he made it an even greater lieeven the senate democrats are angry with him
just sit back and watch obamacare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards the website is the best part of this mess
she is so sad and pathetic that i almost feel sorry for secsebelius she has done great harm to many people and must be fired incompetent
put kathleen sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say youre fired let her go home to her family and rest bring in top flight people
prediction the disaster known as obamacare will only get worse and republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years
a level will be reached where obamacare will be so out of control expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship
if democrats do not start opposing obamacare and fast republicans will have a massive victory in far greater than any predictions

isaidknow awesome rt again more dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in obamacare congratulations thanks
i wonder what the late great vince lombardi would say about the rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled
football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatoryracist and can be viewed as bullying
i wonder if the rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming
the wimps that run penn state should be forced to resign and be sued for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy
maybe some of the dead voters who helped get president obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for obamacare
how did the ncaa which is weak and becoming irrelevant extract such a big reputation shattering settlement from penn state others zero

what a rotten deal we made with iran we get nothing except laughter at our stupidity they get everything including delay and big cash
how far has the united states gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with iran read the art of the deal
i do not understand how so many of my jewish friends backed obama in the last election he is a total disaster for israeland always will be
i will be on fox friends tomorrow morning at will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence of which our leaders have plenty

john kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with iran great dealmakers do not celebrate dealsthey just go on to the next one
the reason great dealmakers do not openly celebrate a deal especially one that is not complete is that it shows weakness to the other side

best book ever on dealmaking or so they say trump the art of the deal go get it and others washington you really can do better
after settling for a ridicilous billion dollars jpmorgans lawyer is critical of the amount of the finewhy did they settle thendumb
dont underestimate yourself or your possibilitieskeep your focus intact and focus on the positives
realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort youre in charge everything starts with you
who would you rather have negotiating with iranpresident obama or toronto mayor ford my money is on ford
obama is going to take away over healthcare plans but he is letting iran keep its nukes just think about that
worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make the art of the deal

dont worry the united states will be great again

i cant believe no one has been fired over the obamacare website fiasco
when do we sue the company for billions that robbed us in creating the hapless obamacare website
how does obama rationalize giving iran in sanction relief when a christian pastor is being tortured in an iranian prison

president obama said over and over again if you like your plan you can keep your plan period this turned out to be a total mill
mr president tell iran to immediately free the christian pastor as a sign of good faith if they refuse break off talksbig sanctions

us froze in iranian assets during hostage crisis now obama is giving it back to iran while christian pastor is jailed dont do it
why doesnt president obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie announce that obamacare was a mistake and deal a really great plan
despite the fact that i have had great success with the words youre fired i do not like firing people but zero on obamacare messno way
can you believe that president karzai of afghanistan is holding out for more more more and refuses to sign deal tell him to go to hell

great advice from my father know everything you can about what youre doing fred c trump
great advice from my mother in god and be true to mary macleod trump
putin has become a big hero in russia with an all time high popularity obama on the other hand has fallen to his lowest ever numbers sad
i believe putin will continue to rebuild the russian empire he has zero respect for obama or the us
we should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever must be very strong to prosper survive
the situation with russia is much more dangerous than most people may think and could lead to world war iii we need great leadership fast
obama must now focus get his mind off marchmadness and lead watch russia closely work hard on the economy and get rid of obamacare
i wonder if apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iphone i hear they will be doing it overdue

golfdigestmag big news from scotland on turnberry which by the way blows pinehurst away tomorrow morning stay tuned
jshamie golfdigestmag couldnt agree more the course is not punishing bad tee shots like a normal us open would boring finish
timgerzabek realdonaldtrump golfdigestmag i thought this was the us open not the wanna be british open
markmoreland its worse for pinehurstresort i know i wouldnt pay to play what looks like a neglected municipal course
worked restaurant for yrs got fired because they didnt think i could keep up no severance would u do that no way
mommom just saw the video of the bus driver saving the woman from jumping off overpass you gave him a rewardgood job donald thanks
foossh golfdigestmag realdonaldtrump he has a point fairways should be green scruff can be as bad as you want wouldnt pay top dollar
id bet the horrible look of pinehurst translates into poor television ratings this is not what golf is about
robertwga realdonaldtrump they think the course should be old school you know like before lawn care technology aka goats
realdonaldtrump please dont let the usga ruin your course in like they did pinehurst i wont
realdonaldtrump look better at lahinch or trump doonbeg true
johnny miller correctly very critical of greens at pinehurst said they should be redone
mattginellagc my position on pinehurst is correct bad for the game a dried out cow pasture you have no clue but keep trying
mattginellagc i have watched open championships at turnberry one of the great golf courses of the world pinehurst not in the same league
mattginellagcsadly matt you dont understand golf even though you think you doi have numerous couses that are far superior to pinehurst

hogdallas realdonaldtrump played trump scotland last tuesday weather and course outstanding thanks
they only changed the term to climate change when the words global warming didnt work anymore come on people get smart
the new hot term that they have recently invented is polar vortex give me a break

i cant believe that the judge in the oscar pistorious case has found him not guilty of murder no one has been more guilty since oj
they should have rebuilt the two buildings of the world trade center exactly as they were except taller and stronger a better statement
yankeerangernv the silver lining in you not buying the bills is that you can hopefully rescue whats left of this country run so true
on we pray for the victims and their families of the attack and give thanks to all who have sacrificed for justice our freedom
realdonaldtrump you should be our new president
the judge in the oscar pistorious case is a total moron she said he didnt act like a killer this is another oj disaster
the socalled syrian rebels pledged their allegiance to isis after address we should not be arming them
sen kay hagan voted for amnesty obamacare she is a proven liberal who recklessly goes along with obama vote thomtillis in november
be prepared to joe montana
realdonaldtrump for president
realdonaldtrump mr trump please help us get an autism service dog for our son carson how much do you need

realdonaldtrump i would love for you to run what would be your plan on stopping isis military mom here love you
eastonwestwood please run for president again america is almost finished but might have a chance if youre president in
bentrolling realdonaldtrump eastonwestwood disclosing his finances would make donald trump the most wealthy president ever so true
secretary kerry cannot get other nations to join us in fighting isis they are afraid and he is a poor salesman who reps a pathetic leader
bentrolling realdonaldtrump eastonwestwood donald trump has more know how grit and integrity than george w bush very true
if youre interested in balancing work and pleasure stop instead make your work more pleasurable donald trump
money was never a big motivation for me except as a way to keep score the real excitement is playing the game
bentrolling realdonaldtrump eastonwestwood that isnt even a real number nice try you will see donald trump by a landslide in

promise to build an international coalition against isis is already broken no one trusts him at home or abroad
congratulations to obama on building a strong economy there are people on food stamps a historic record
expect to build up the weak by pulling down the calvin coolidge
if you focus with unyielding resolve then you will never be successful believe in yourself and you can accomplish your goals
i left atlantic city years ago good timing now i may buy back in at much lower price to save plaza taj they were run badly by funds
it is so sad to see what has happened to atlantic city so many bad decisions by the pols over the years airport convention center etc
can you believe that the us will be sending troops to africa to help with ebolathey will come home infected we have enough problems
does anybody notice that atlantic city lost its magic after i left years ago i had the big boxing introduced ufc ask danathe best shows
ive realized that success requires effort and focus nothing less
entrepreneurs achievers move forward at all times achievement is not a plateau its a beginning
entrepreneurs believe in yourself if you dont no one else will either

congratulations to sixteenchicago trumpchicago for being honored with a michelinguidechi twostar rating again this year
at least obamacareromneycare architect gruber admitted albeit privately that we were lied to by obama gang of liars
that some things are worth waiting for plans can change sometimes for good trump never give up
obamacare will continue to stop entrepreneurship slow growth and halt research development defund repeal replace
true competitors are the ones who always play to tom brady patriots
entrepreneurs always remember that deals are fluid terms are always negotiable and time can be the best option for success
there are many jonathan gruber types selling the global warming stuff and they really do believe the american public is stupid

premiering on january the season of apprenticenbc will have major fireworks every episode the board room is electric
fact amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform
there is no excuse for riots in ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome
isis is starting its own currency may be stronger than the dollar if obamacare is fully implemented
iran and the united states just pushed deadline back seven months on working out a nuclear deal iran is tapping along our bad negotiators
why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in ferguson at in the evening a prime time for riots not smart
dmellette realdonaldtrump for president
realdonaldtrump cant wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what obama destroyed
this is why we need realdonaldtrump in office barackobama doesnt know how to keep order
despite having a black president the racial divide seems greater than it has in decadesif obama were a leader this would not be the case
if the decision by the grand jury in ferguson was the exact opposite you would still be having the riots right now
can you imagine what putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the us as they watch the ferguson riot
as china and the rest of the world continue to rip off the us economically they laugh at us and our president over the riots in ferguson
sadly because president obama has done such a poor job as president you wont see another black president for generations
our country is totally fractured and with our weak leadership in washington you can expect ferguson type riots and looting in other places
who is the moron who decided to release the ferguson grand jury findings after oclock in the evening what were they thinking
president obama has absolutely no control or respect over the african american communitythey have fared so poorly under his presidency
why is it almost every person i know thinks that mac millers only song is donald trump and then he disappeared true

i could fix tv talk shows that are doing is tremendous talent out there waiting to be nobody sees it
the evening news broadcasts must stop talking about and too many other topics
the mexican legal system is corrupt as is much of mexico pay me the money that is owed me now and stop sending criminals over our border

once again the bush appointed supreme court justice john roberts has let us down jeb pushed him hard remember
anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the us should boycott univision
univision cares far more about mexico than it does about the us are they controlled by the mexican government
if i win the presidency my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike bushs appointee john roberts on obamacare

now that the mexican drug lord escaped from prison everyone is saying that most of the cocaine etc coming into the us comes over border

the us will invite el chapo the mexican drug lord who just escaped prison to become a us citizen because our leaders cant say no
el chapo and the mexican drug cartels use the border unimpeded like it was a vacuum cleaner sucking drugs and death right into the us
likewise billions of dollars gets brought into mexico through the border we get the killers drugs crime they get the money

just left family leadership summit in iowa got a standing ovation from many wonderful people i will be back soon
in addition to doing a lousy job in taking care of our vets john mccain let us down by losing to barack obama in his run for president
captured or not all our soldiers are heroes
the veterans of our country have been treated like third class citizens for many years
john mccain has failed miserably to fix the situation and to make it possible for veterans to successfully manage their lives
all he does is go on television is talk talk talk but incapable of doing anything
i will make this right for our great vets
its a national embarrassment that an illegal immigrant can walk across the border and receive free health care and one of our veterans
that has served our country is put on a waiting list and gets no care
i have a proven track record supporting our veterans veterans deserve universal access to care va scandal proves politicians are inept
congrats to the new gov of texas gregabbotttx for taking a tough bold stance at the border should have been done long ago by perry
why would anybody listen to mittromney he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama by the wayso did john mccain
one of the reasons i am no fan of john mccain is that our vets are being treated so badly by him and the politicians i will fix va quickly
amsardina realdonaldtrump sharylattkisson kick there ass trump
dunncheri sharylattkisson mr trump the only one telling the truth liberals cant stand the fact that your are leading in the poll
sharylattkisson why do they attack mr trump because he has something they dont the ability of truth trump is here
john mccain called thousands of people crazies when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in phoenix he owes apology
the veterans administration is in shambles and our veterans are suffering greatly john mccain has done nothing to help them but talk
the republican party must get tougher and smarter and fast or it will go down to a very big defeat just like the last two times
i will be making some very big campaign stops next week big crowds and tremendous energy make america great again
mccain epitomizes the career politicians who have gotten us into our trillion trainwreck including the va debacle
pgrant they cant handle you donald so want you out the race well good luckbecause we know you wont walk away give it to them

vetapologist this is big criticism of the republican field speak truth and stop being so pc this is why realdonaldtrump resonates
eod i believe we have passed that point there are homeless veterans in usa yet illegal aliens get government housing
rtmatador trump says things that no one else would even consider saying i agree with him on the immigration situation i love honesty
andrewstilesusa realdonaldtrump trump already hosts vets at his resorts what does hillary do
realdonaldtrump the left is petrified of you why else would they be attacking you so vigorously
linflies chriscuomo deptvetaffairs rest of gop only cries but trump gets stuff done
amit realdonaldtrump i agree mccain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our vets
it was only after i informed nbc that i wouldnt do the apprentice that they became upset w me they care less about

look how small the pages have become wsj looks like a money i assume
i will be interviewed on oreillyfactor tonight at will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans illegal immigration etc
realdonaldtrump oreillyfactor ill watch anything that gives you a chance to share your views go donald

tomllamasabc cannot report the news truthfully why not apologize for your fraudulent story on world news tonightgang members criminals

tomllamasabc so refreshing to have someone call out these left wingers posing as journalists keep it up trump

we are going to make our country so strong again so great again no more ripping off the united states we will make america great again
alabama will shine tomorrow it will be a big and glorious day
jeb bush signed memo saying not to use the term anchor babies offensive now he wants to use it because i use it stay true to yourself
how crazy of all births in us are to illegal immigrants over babies per year this must stop unaffordable and not right
boston incident is terrible we need energy and passion but we must treat each other with respect i would never condone violence
leaving for mobile alabama right now cant be late
dow dives more than points down from high be careful
jessebwatters you did a great job hosting oreillyfactor everybody loved it thank you for the nice words
alabama was great last night amazing people folks was largest crowd of political season nice
dojiedojie realdonaldtrump keep talking donaldthe people want to hear it loud and clear
politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source and that is saying something they go out of their way to distort truth
i had people in phoenix but politico said the rooms capacity is just over but said bernie sanders had in same room
thank you to the washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in alabama last night it was a great evening
how is bernie sanders going to defend our country if he cant even defend his own microphone very sad
now that i started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border most other candidates are finally speaking up just politicians
jeb bush is weak on illegal immigration in favor of common core bad on womens health issues and thinks the iraq war was a good thing
jeb bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body jeb just cant get it right
the last thing we need is another bush in the white house would be the same old thing remember read my lips no more taxes greatness
new reuters poll just came out and has me at highest number yetthe silent majority is back and we will make america great again

bigpaulfla realdonaldtrump she has come back looking like nancy grace
swampbug seanhannity cruz is my secondthird choice carson is also a good man i look at it as war so my choice is trump

jerihyatt megynkelly jebbush so true jeb bush is crazy who cares that he speaks mexican this is america english
patrickstinard megynkelly kelly file was much better without megyn kelly her replacement while she was out on vacation was much better
jeb bush never uses his last name on advertising signage materials etc is he ashamed of the name bush a pretty sad situation go jeb
in a clumsy move to get out of his anchor babies dilemma where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it he blamed asians
asians are very offended that jeb said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics a mess
jeb bush just talked about my border proposal to build a fence its not a fence jeb its a wall and theres a big difference
governorpataki did a terrible job as governor of new york if he ran again he would have lost in a landslide he and graham zero in polls
ibemoshing no hope for jeb bush anymore realdonaldtrump has been on fire really hope he can get the win and fix this country
gov scott walker has ran wisconsins economy into the ground how dare he criticize you you would fire him in a second
ragefelix governorpataki i lived in ny when tacky pataki was gov he was a total disaster for the people of new york

nrmandela realdonaldtrump and youre still a negative loser and trump is still a positive winner im black and proudly voting trump
bellicwolf andisw anyway for me the most original costume was donald trump like president
further proof that gang of eight member marco rubio is weak on illegal immigration is paul singers mr amnesty endorsementrubs cant win
jebs new slogan jeb can fix it i never thought of jeb as a crook stupid message the word fix is not a good one to use in politics
i told you in speeches months ago that jeb and marco do not like each other marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to jeb as his mentor
marco rubio will not win weak on illegal immigration strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a lightweight
if jeb bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with marco in the debate bad facts for marco if properly delivered
while in politics it is often smart to send out false messages one thing is clear that hillary does not want to run against trump

florida ethics commission advocate comes down hard on rubio so do two people who worked with him said he used the wrong credit card sure
with ben carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and pyramids built for grain storage dont people get it
carson now admits his friend named bob who he tried to stab bob was saved by his belt buckle no longer exists as bob wrong name

wsj editorial board should review my debate statement re china and tpp and apologize china not part but will get their way in later
the wsj editorial board is so wrong so often they got info from an incorrect story in another pub why not watch and listen to debate
when and how are the dummies at the wsj going to apologize to me for their totally incorrect editorial on me i want smart trade deals
why wouldnt the wsj call for comment or clarification before writing an editorial which is so totally wrong no wonder it is doing poorly
we as a country either have borders or we dont if we dont have borders we dont have a country
karlrove is a biased dope who wrote falsely about me re china and tpp this moron wasted million on political campaigns and lost
why does the failing wsj write a false editorial about me and let dummy karlrove make the same mistake in the same edition of the paper

refugees from syria are now pouring into our great country who knows who they are some could be isis is our president insane
one of the saddest things in journalism is what happened to the formerly great ap they have lost their way and are no longer credible
ap is doing very badly i can say from experience their reporting is terrible highly inaccurate sadly they are now irrelevant

the legendary barbara walters interviews melania trump and me on a special this friday night at on abc dont miss it
governor kasich whose failed campaign debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend million against me
john kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me
john kasich despite being governor of ohio is losing to me in the ohio polls pathetic
i want to do negative ads on john kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that i want to waste my money
watch kasich squirm if he is not truthful in his negative ads i will sue him just for fun
kasich has already spent million on ads in new hampshire and his numbers have gone down people from nh are smart
i loved beating john kasich in the debates but it was came in dead last
john kasich ad guy wanted to work for me but his proposal was a rip off i said no now ripping kasich
help kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else almost last
john kasich fell right into president trap on obamacare and the people of ohio are suffering for it shame
once john kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete total dud
john kasich was managing director of lehman brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining peoples lives a total failure
the media must immediately stop calling isis leaders masterminds call them instead thugs and losers young people must not go into isis
the media must denigrate isis at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it these are low level degenerates not masterminds

the failing nytimes should be focused on good reporting and the papers financial survival and not with constant hits on donald trump
realdonaldtrump wkrg i lived in new jersey at that time and witnessed all that as well
the nytimes is so poorly run and managed that other family members are looking to take over control with unfunded liabilitiesbig trouble
the dopes at the nytimes bought the boston globe for billion and sold it for their great old headquartersgave it away so dumb
so since the people at the nytimes have made all bad decisions over the last decade why do people care what they write incompetent
the numbers at the nytimes are so dismal especially advertising revenue that big help will be needed fast a once great institutionsad
happy thanksgiving to all have a great day and look forward to the future we will make america great again

vylvisaker anncoulter trump has stamina he is working harder than any other candidate he really loves america he deserves to win
schnoepoe foxnews i find myself more and more drawn to cnn for fairness regarding realdonaldtrump the fox news sunday pundits a joke
everyone vote for realdonaldtrump and no he did not pay me for this endorsement
i did interview with chris wallace of foxnews in order to be fair he then puts on rove lane and will three trump bashers to discuss
i was disappointed that ted cruz would speak behind my back get caught and then deny it well welcome to the wonderful world of politics
schnoepoe foxnews not so much fairness as it is about ratings megan kellys hate nightly of trump is turnoff for fox
foxnews thats why after your interview i couldnt watch the panel discussion which is usually my favorite segment
trump needs his own poll a real poll in every state these polls are so ridiculousthe media will only get worse from here
lesgartcpa jaketapper realdonaldtrump problem is i never watched you until trump started giving you interviews and ratings on cnn
people have got to stop working to be so politically correct and focus all of their energy on finding solutions to very complex problems
barbaranc trump did not need wealth power owes nothing to anyone candidates owe their backers
why doesnt foxnews quote the new iowa cnn poll where i have a to lead over ted cruz and all others think about it
another great accolade for trumpgolf highly respected golf odyssey awarded trumpdoral blue monster with best redesign thank you
cant believe major league baseball just rejected for the hall of fame hes paid the price so ridiculous let him in

piersmorgan donald trump vs hillary clinton would be the greatest presidential battle in history
wow i just had two very good iowa polls and a phenomenal just out national poll from abc washingtonpost make america great again
isnt it amazing that cnn paid a fortune for an iowa poll which shows me in first place over cruz by to then doesnt use it
why isnt anyone using the cnn iowa poll with me having a big lead they only want to use the one negative poll placedishonest press
megynkelly the most overrated anchor at foxnews worked hard to explain away the new monmouth poll to or pt lead she said
megynkelly is very bad at math she was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and cruz in the new monmouth poll
i wonder if megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight no matter how well i do bad
i am in trump international hotel las vegas getting ready and waiting for the debate tonight look forward hope i get treated fairly
between iraq war monger krauthammer dummy karlrove deadpan georgezwill highly overrated megynkelly among others foxnews not fair
i won every debate so far according to all debate polls including drudgereport time slate and more too bad dopey megynkelly lies
highly respected public policy polling ppp just announced that i am number one in iowa thank you

melindadc misrepresent in order to make a point i was always tough on isisas find out after i get elected
i have an idea for jebbush whose campaign is a disaster try using your last name be ashamed of it
weak ineffective jebbush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response false advertising
jebbush has embarrassed himself his family with his incompetent campaign for president he should remain true to himself
the last thing our country needs is another bush dumb as a rock
see sanders backed hillary on emails at the debate hurting himself and then she threw him under the bus but failed disloyal person
president obama spends so much time speaking of the socalled carbon footprint and yet he flies all the way to hawaii on a massive old
gstephanopoulos stupidly believes that hillary wants to run against me because she said so she says that so people believe it opposite
gstephanopoulos as realdonaldtrump dominates the latest polls talk to the gop frontrunner sunday on thisweekabc
tomskeet realdonaldtrump gstephanopoulos haha shes not ready for the donald
jonkarl was totally misled and he fell for it that hillary wants to run against me she knows that i am her worst nightmarejon doesnt
domineeksmith realdonaldtrump is the best republican presidential candidate of all time thank you
hillary clinton lied when she said that isis is using video of donald trump as a recruiting tool this was fact checked by foxnews false
jebbush was terrible on face the nation today being at and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence a basket case
hillary clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no isis video of me therefore hillary lied at the debate last night sad
it was really strange when hillary was missing from the podium last night not very presidential
missuniverse final on now great people great new owner img watch
jebbush today said he didnt want to be the frontrunner he would rather be where he is now that is the talk of a loser cant win
tell this knitwit speakerryan the ppl want realdonaldtrump not him or his choice for president thts why trump has
very sad what happened last night at the miss universe pageant i sold it months ago for a record price this would never have happened
hillary said at debate isis is going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst she made up storywant apology
i demand an apology from hillary clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate there never was a video
hillary said with respect to isis we are finally where we need to be do we want more years of incompetent leadership maga
just out trump gop debate clinton democrat debate and they were on major network vs cable
getting ready to go to the great state of michigan big crowd tonight make america great again
its the democrats total weakness incompetence that gave rise to isis not a tape of donald trump that was an admitted hillary lie

realdonaldtrump got my autographed book yesterday cant wait to read it you got them scared to death love it great
realdonaldtrump donald trump supporter go trump make america great again
realnevadie this suggests that online polls are more reliable so trump is crushing both parties realdonaldtrump
msfl realdonaldtrump a great patriot
weak and low energy jebbush whose campaign is a disaster is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy
jebbush just took millions of s in special interest money to look like a tough guy will never work
will jebbush in his phony advertising campaign show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate
why doesnt jebbush in his ads show my answer to his statement in the debate
jebbushs opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terriblefumbled around incoherent
qbeacademy well im at and your at you know jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage classic
jebbush the donald shouldve been named man of the year he dominates the polls news talk shows social media maga
watching cnn and consider secupp to be one of the least talented people on television boring and biased
jebs big ad buy against me paid for by lobbyists shows my face but doesnt have me answering jebs statements he is really pathetic
wow new reuters poll just out big lead if you want to make america great again trump cruz this is at the top of drudge
when i said that hillary clinton got schlonged by obama it meant got beaten badly the media knows this often used word in politics
it is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong sad
we need a president with strength stamina heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again
big news just out new cnn poll trump and leads in every major category likeability way up cruz carson rubio
the hillary clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic be careful hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card
foxnews treats me so badly using old quinnipiac poll where i have a much smaller lead than the just out cnn poll all negative
why does foxnews give karlrove so much airtime he and other fox pundits is so biased still thinks romney won unfair coverage of trump
it is hard to believe i am winning by so much when i am treated so badly by the media new cnn poll amazing in all categories pt lead
hillary when you complain about a penchant for sexism who are you referring to i have great respect for women be careful
hillary said i really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign i deplore the death and destruction she causedstupidity
ihatematt realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run shes a criminal good question
ihatematt realdonaldtrump why is hillary even allowed to run shes a criminal
classyexplorer gatewaypundit jim you fail to mention in your cnn poll that in the gop racetrump is leading cruz to detail
poor jebbush spent million on his campaign i spent almost nothing hes bottom and gone im top by a lot thats what us needs
in the ridiculous jebbush ad about me jeb is speaking to me during the debate but doesnt allow my answer which destroys him so sad
wow even lowly rand paul has just past jebbush in the new cnn poll jeb is at im at stop throwing your money down the drain
third rate reporters amy chozick and maggie haberman of the failing nytimes are totally in the hillary circle of bias think about bill
next year will be an interesting one i look forward to running against hillary clinton a totally flawed candidate and beating her soundly
wow because of the pressure put on by me ice to launch large scale deportation raids its about time
why isnt chucktodd using the much newer cnn poll when discussing how well i am doing instead of the older q poll cnn even better
meetthepress and chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new cnn poll where i am at higher than cruz be honest chuck
i am now in palm beach florida and will be going to church tonight make america great again
yesmrgilbert nbcnightlynews halliejackson should have talked to megyn kelly about this story true a total distortion of the facts
halliejackson why didnt you report hillary lying about the isis video bad reporting perhaps nbc will do better next yearbut doubt it
danielhalper great job on cnn today very wise indeed
merry christmas to all have a great day and have a really amazing year together we will make america great again it will be done
deedeesorvino was great today on foxnews she gets what is going on in politics and sees it very clearly have her on more
does everyone see that the democrats and president obama are now because of me starting to deport people who are here illegally politics
we have many problems in our house country and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay make america great again
remember when failed candidate jebbush said that illegals came across the border as an act of love hes spent million and is at
our great veterans are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the va that will stop i will fix this quickly
when will the democrats and hillary in particular say we must build a wall a great wall and mexico is going to pay for it never
foxnews thank you for your tweet today on christmas cant wait to see you as president mr trump you are awesome
you know whats making my christmas great familyfoodfriendsyou i have my trump shirt on whope in my heart for america
chucktodd is so dishonest in his reportingand to think he was going off the air until i came alongno ratings i will beat hillary
the same people that said i wouldnt run or that i wouldnt lead or do well place and leading by now say i wont beat hillary
the phoenix va it has just been reported is in worse shape than ever before the wait is horrendous and people are dying i will fix it
criminal deportations in the us are the lowest number in many years we are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country must change
a new terror warning was issued for european cties at what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart weak leaders
hillary clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but hes demonstrated a penchant for sexism so inappropriate
i will do far more for women than hillary and i will keep our country safe something which she will not be able to dono strengthstamina
i will be interviewed on foxandfriends at will be talking about hillary and far more interesting subjects enjoy
mitchellvii face it trey gowdy failed miserably on benghazi he allowed it to drag out and in the end let hillary get away with murder
mitchellvii my prediction on the trey gowdy endorsement of rubio is that it will do nothing for rubio and finish gowdy
he supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that trey gowdy is going to campaign with him
jimvitari realdonaldtrump we need the change trump is going to make not the change obama did by ruining the country
legacyrealtorsj you will come out tops mr trump you are sincere genuine hard working honest and willl do what you promise the people

why are jebbush flunkies ananavarro and secupp two of the dumbest people in politics always on the cnn panelsand yet polltrump
realdonaldtrump whats going on in va whats the gop doing they will lose the state because of the rnc

isabellegirlxo realdonaldtrump jebbush ananavarro secupp cnn ana is an illegal who needs to be deported no shes just incompetent
straighten out the republican party of virginia before it is too late stupid rnc
hopefully the republican national committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in virginias republican party fast
borntobegop realdonaldtrump we need a real president to get things done and thats why we want you thank you
if hillary thinks she can unleash her husband with his terrible record of women abuse while playing the womens card on me shes wrong
the middleclass has worked so hard are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of and no effective raise in years bad
many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone shipped to other countries we now are part time sad i will fix
wages in are country are too low good jobs are too few and people have lost faith in our leaderswe need smart and strong leadership now
strange but i see wacko bernie sanders allies coming over to me because im lowering taxes while he will double triple them a disaster

im going to be live with ericbolling and kimguilfoyle to ring in the new year everybody should tune in to foxnews tomorrow night
i predict that dying unionleader newspaper which has been run into the ground by publisher stinky joe mcquaid will be dead in years

jebbush has spent and is at the bottom of the polls i have spent almost nothing and am at the top win hughhewitt
realdonaldtrump jebbush hughhewitt patriots for trump
realdonaldtrump veterans love trump but i love the vets even more
realdonaldtrump jebbush hughhewitt jeb is such a lightweight
realdonaldtrump jebbush hughhewitt i get pissed off every time i see his ads on fox waste of money go trump many do
people ask why do you tweet and retweet to millions about jebbush when he is so low in the polls because of his big hit ads on me
bretbaier realdonaldtrumps reaction that lindseygrahamsc is dropping out of the race your thoughts
sensanders i have a message for donald trump no not going to hate latinos not going to hate muslims i fully agree
deggow just heard a year old man say i would rather work for donald trump than bernie sandersits time for me to leave this party
i would feel sorry for jebbush and how badly he is doing with his campaign other than for the fact he took millions of s of hit ads on me

i will be going to mississippi tomorrow night hear the crowds are going to be massive look forward to it
the person that hillary clinton least wants to run against is by far me it will be the largest voter turnout ever she will be swamped
jebbush is a sad case a total embarrassment to both himself and his family he just announced he will continue to spend on trump hit ads
jebbush is a low energy stiff who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls has no chance
hillary clinton said that it is ok to ban muslims from israel by building a wall but not ok to do so in the us we must be vigilant
hillary clinton doesnt have the strength or stamina to be president jeb bush is a low energy individual but hillary is not much better
i hope bill clinton starts talking about womens issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how hillary abused those women
when i look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates beware the candidates are mere puppets
remember i am selffunding my campaign the only one in either party im not controlled by lobbyists or special interestsonly the usa
just arrived in mississippi for the rally word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive will be an amazing evening
just returned from mississippi a great evening
hillary clinton lied last week when she said isis made a dt video the video that isis made was about her husband being a degenerate
alshabbab not isis just made a video on me they all will as frontrunner if i speak out against them which i must hillary lied
hillary said that guns dont keep you safe if she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm

ted cruz was born in canada and was a canadian citizen until months ago lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow i told you so
ted cruz said he didnt know that he was a canadian citizen he also forgot to file his goldman sachs million loan papersnot believable
was there another loan that ted cruz forgot to file goldman sachs owns him he will do anything they demand not much of a reformer
the ted cruz wiseguy apology to the people of new york is a disgrace remember his wifes employer and his lender is located there
oh no just reported that ted cruz didnt report another loan this one from citi wow no wonder banks do so well in the us senate
based on the fact that ted cruz was born in canada and is therefore a natural born canadian did he borrow unreported loans from c banks
ted cruz purposely and illegally did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks they own him
if ted cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage
everybody that loves the people of new york and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like ted cruz out of politics
when will tedcruz give all the new york based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him
greatly dishonest of tedcruz to file a financial disclosure form not list his lending banks then pretend he is going to clean up wall st
wow ted cruz received in campaign contributions from a ny hedge fund mogul low int loan from goldman sachs hypocrite
is this the new york that ted cruz is talking about
interesting read from peggy
in iran deal we get prisoners they get billion most wanted and many off watch list this will create great incentive for others
iran is going to buy jetliners with a small part of the billion we are giving thembut they wont buy from us rather airbus

national review is a failing publication that has lost its way its circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low sad
very few people read the national review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead

ted cruz complains about my views on eminent domain but without it we wouldnt have roads highways airports schools or even pipelines
realollietaylor isnt it time we had a president let goofy glen keep canada cruz who cant win the american people have trump
highly respected constitutional law professor mary brigid mcmanamon has just stated ted cruz is not eligible to be president big problem
the failing nro national review magazine has just been informed by the republican national committee that they cannot participate in debate

brentbozell one of the national review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog why doesnt he say that
the only reason irrelevant glennbeck doesnt like me is i refused to do his failing show asked many times very few listeners sad
cruz says i supported tarp which gave million to goldman sachs the bank which loaned him the money he didnt disclose puppet
is cruz honest he is in bed w wall st is funded by goldman sachsciti low interest loans no legal disclosure never sold off assets

pictwittercomsmtklpibyd
i refuse to call megyn kelly a bimbo because that would not be politically correct instead i will only call her a lightweight reporter
the statement put out yesterday by foxnews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism who would ever say something so nasty dumb
just got to listen to rush limbaugh the guy is fantastic
even though i beat him in the first six debates especially the last one ted cruz wants to debate me again can we do it in canada
i will be interviewed on oreillyfactor tonight at pm eastern enjoy

they say that if i participated in last fox debate they would have had million more would have broken the all time record
the new email release is a disaster for hillary clinton at a minimum how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president
the great state of nebraska can do much better than bensasse as your senator saw him on greta totally ineffective wants paid for pols
bensasse looks more like a gym rat than a us senator how the hell did he ever get elected greta
amazing that ted cruz cant even get a senator like bensasse who is easy to endorse him not one senator is endorsing canada ted
foxnews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night raised in one hour for our vets
oreillyfactor the people of iowa love the fact that i stuck up for my rights as i will do for the us also got for our vets
classyexplorer oreillyfactor drudge so bill if america was so longing to learn more about candidates why the percent audience loss
gigglemitz geraldorivera foxnews damn fox is really acting like a baby today i guess trump got under their skin pretty biased

i will be in iowa all day and until tuesday morning finally after all these years of watching stupidity we will make america great again
the cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters in violation they are now under investigation bad
bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy asked me for expensive hotel rooms free and more i said pay and he endorsed cruz
bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event the people holding the event called me to say he wanted for himselfphony foxandfriends
bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man when i wouldnt give him free hotel rooms and much more he endorsed cruz foxandfriends
i will be going to church in iowa this morning with my wife melania after church i will be making two speeches and touring the state
ted cruz is totally unelectable if he even gets to run born in canada will loose big to hillary polls show i beat hillary easily win
ted cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important financial disclosure form very low interest loans scam
wow just saw an ad cruz is lying on so many levels there is nobody more against obamacare than me will repeal replace he lies
by not doing the failed poorly rated debate i was able to make the point of not allowing unfairness while raising for vets
if i would have done the last debate a record would have been set instead of the poor ratings recieved also vets got
i am in iowa will be interviewed on this week with gstephanopoulos this morning enjoy
i will be interviewed on face the nation with jdickerson this morning enjoy
it all begins today we will finally take our country back and make america great again
my experience in iowa was a great one i started out with all of the experts saying i couldnt do well there and ended up in place nice
because i was told i could not do well in iowa i spent very little there a fraction of cruz rubio came in a strong second great honor
the media has not covered my longshot great finish in iowa fairly brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history
i will be talking about my wonderful experience in iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the medialater in new hampshire big crowd
i dont believe i have been given any credit by the voters for selffunding my campaign the only one i will keep doing but not worth it
morningjoe mikebarnicle on realdonaldtrump he finished but he made the turn successfully like a pro
lorewestphal realdonaldtrump you must win the presidency in
realdonaldtrump if you can do that well in iowa then i see you acing it in all other significant states momentum is growing
ellenespence realdonaldtrump amazing job in iowa cruz just barely won
stephbewitching realdonaldtrump all you haters need to realize trump got the second highest vote in history and hes never held office
anybody who watched all of ted cruzs far too long rambling overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his howard dean moment
great job on donlemon tonight kayleighmcenany cherijacobus begged us for a job we said no and she went hostile a real dummy cnn
ted cruz didnt win iowa he stole it that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated bad
during primetime of the iowa caucus cruz put out a release that realbencarson was quitting the race and to caucus or vote for cruz
many people voted for cruz over carson because of this cruz fraud also cruz sent out a voter violation certificate to thousands of voters
the voter violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting votergrade of f and told them to clear it up by voting for cruz fraud
and finally cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers voters that trump was strongly in favor of obamacare and choice a total lie
based on the fraud committed by senator ted cruz during the iowa caucus either a new election should take place or cruz results nullified
i will be interviewed on greta at pm enjoy foxnews
the state of iowa should disqualify ted cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated a total fraud
dr ben carson blasted ted cruz for deceit and dirty tricks and lies
sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesnt want to run against me he would be so easy to beat
thank you billoreilly karlrove ted cruz should be immediately disqualified in iowa with each candidate moving up one notch
oreillyfactor karlrove as per the show an even more serious cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone
this is the cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone a misdemeanor at

jeb bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a super bowl ad he is a weak candidate
everybody is laughing at jeb bushspent million and is at bottom of pack a pathetic figure
now that bush has wasted million of special interest money on his failed campaign he says he would end super pacs sad
remember jebbush wants common core education from dc and is very weak on illegal immigration come as act of love not a leader
i know the governors and jeb bush who has gone nasty with lies is by far the weakest of the lot his family used private eminent domain
noone has done more for people with disabilities than me i have spent many millions of dollars to help outand am happy to have done so

dopey mort zuckerman owner of the worthless nydailynews has a major inferiority complex paper will close soon
worthless nydailynews which dopey mort zuckerman is desperately trying to sell has no buyer liabilities are massive
like the worthless nydailynews looks like politico will be going out of business bad reporting no money no cred
such a great experience in new hampshire amazing people will be leaving for a big event in south carolina today
so funny jeb bush called me a highly gifted politician and a great entertainer i assume that is a compliment
big speech tonight in south carolina pm tremendous crowd
i was referring to the fact that jeb bush wants to keep common core
haryder which is it realdonaldtrump are you planning on getting rid of common core or keeping it get rid of it fast
i have been consistent in my opposition to common core get rid of common core keep education local
there are no buyers for the worthless nydailynews but little mort zuckerman is frantically looking it is bleeding red ink a total loser
jeb bush spent more than in new hampshire to come in or i spent to come in big difference in capability
markhalperin showed a focus group on morningjoe me using a very bad word i never said the word left an open blank please apologize
remember it was the republican party with the help of conservatives that made so many promises to their base but didnt keep them hi dt
he or she who hesitates is lost make america great again
jeb failed as jeb he gave up and enlisted mommy and his brother who got us into the quicksand of iraq spent millionweakno chance
we are getting reports from many voters that the cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest pushpolls on me we are watching
truthinvest cnn tedcruz realdonaldtrump ted cruz is the definition of sleaze just ask realbencarson
lying cruz put out a statement rubio are wobama on gay marriage cruz is the worst liar crazy or very dishonest perhaps all
how can ted cruz be an evangelical christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest
the failing nydailynews destroyed by little morty zuckerman is preparing to close and save face by going online its dead
nothing conservative about the club for growth coming into my office and demanding a contribution which naturally they did not get
after hearing the news that they would not be able to extort from me they went hostile w a series of incorrect illinformed ads
lightweight jebbush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in sc false advertising desperate and sad
if tedcruz clean up his act stop cheating doing negative ads i have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen
last time lightweight jebbush tried to knock off marcorubio he made a total fool of himself if he doesnt do better this time he is out
by tedcruz good i want to see the court decide what i was always told natural born means born on american soil
realdonaldtrump do americans really want a canadianborn president first non native born in history
millions of s of false ads paid for by lobbyistsspecial interests of cheater sentedcruz and sleepy jebbush are now running in sc

i will be on face the nation with john dickerson on cbs this morning enjoy
loved the debate last night and almost everyone said i won but the rnc did a terrible job of ticket distrbution all donors special ints
tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists special interests the bosses
wow in the new cbs poll i went way up into the forties thank you
ted cruz along with jeb bush pushed justice john roberts onto the supreme court roberts could have killed obamacare twice but didnt
funny that jeb didnt want help from his family in his failed campaign and didnt even want to use his last namethen mommy now brother
jeb bush and ted cruz are not electable presidential candidates hillary would destroy them ted may not be eligible to run born in canada
i will be in south carolina all week saturday is big big big get out and vote make america great again
now that george bush is campaigning for jeb is he fair game for questions about world trade center iraq war and eco collapse careful
id like to call jeb a liar but the truth is he has no clue never revealed that he used eminent domain when criticizing me
spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in south carolina great people and spirit today will be more of the same

thank you kayleighmcenany for your nice words great knowledge and style we are doing really well in south carolina cnn donlemon

why does megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me almost always negative without me her ratings would tank get a life megyn
interesting how president obama so haltingly said i would never be president this from perhaps the worst president in us history
lindseygraham who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace saying the most horrible things about me on foxnews
i will beat hillary easily but lindsey graham says i wont and yet he got zero against me no cred why does fox put him on
foxnews is so biased it is disgusting they do not want trump to win all negative
just out nevada poll shows jeb bush at he should take his dumb mouthpiece lindseygrahamsc and just go home
jeb bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses he wants to look cool but its far too late in nevada
amazing that while i lead by big numbers in the new q and and usa today polls the the press only wants to report on the phony wsjnbc poll
the just out usa today national poll where i lead by big numbers shows that in a head to head matchup i beat both hillary and bernie
i love being in south carolina we are leading big in all of the state polls saturday is a big day make america great again
new cbs national poll just out massive lead for trump the wall street journalnbc poll is a total joke no wonder wsj is doing so badly
foxnews is changing their theme from fair and balanced to unfair and unbalanced but dying wsj is worsetheir phony poll is a joke

i am in las vegas at the best hotel by far trump international i will be working with my wonderful teams and volunteers to win nevada
the reason that ted cruz lost the evangelicals in sc is because he is a world class liar and evangelicals do not like liars

north carolina lost manufacturing jobs and ohio lost since going to mexico etc no more if i win we will bring back
watching john kasich being interviewed acting so innocent and like such a nice guy remember him in second debate until i put him down

i will be interviewed on the oreilly factor this evening at pm on the fox news channel oreillyfactor
stuart stevens the failed campaign manager of mitt romneys historic loss is now telling the republican party what to do with trump sad
crazy megynkelly supposedly had lyin ted cruz on her show last night ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse ted cant win
great news that foxnews has cancelled the additional debate how many times can the same people ask the same question i beat cruz debating
crazy megynkelly is now complaining that oreillyfactor did not defend her against me yet her bad show is a total hit piece on metough
the reason lyin ted cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just dont tolerate liarsa big problem
wsj editorial says clinton primary vote total is is knock but she had only opponentsi had
wsj is bad at math the good news is nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore especially me
please explain to the dummies at the wsj editorial board that i love to debate and have won according to drudge etc all of them
looking like my victories on tuesday will be just as good as if i won ohio two more days and ohio was mine
highly overrated crazy megynkelly is always complaining about trump and yet she devotes her shows to me focus on others megyn
make america great again
hillary clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life
lyin ted cruz lost all five races on tuesdayand he was just given the jinx a lindsey graham endorsement also backed jeb lindsey got
senator lindseygrahamsc made horrible statements about sentedcruz and then he endorsed him no wonder nobody trusts politicians
ewerickson got fired like a dog from redstate and now he is the one leading opposition against me
with millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment my numbers continue to go up can anyone explain this
club for growth tried to extort from me when i said no they went hostile with negative ads disgraceful
club for growth letter trying to extort from me remember i said
going to salt lake city utah for a big rally lyin ted cruz should not be allowed to win there mormons dont like liars i beat hillary
failed presidential candidate mitt romney the man who choked and let us all down is now endorsing lyin ted cruz this is good for me
failed presidential candidate mitt romney was campaigning with john kasich marco rubio and now he is endorsing ted cruz
mitt romney is a mixed up man who doesnt have a clue no wonder he lost
everybody should boycott the megynkelly show never worth watching always a hit on trump she is sick the most overrated person on tv
do you believe that hillary clinton now wants obamacare for illegal immigrants she should spend more time taking care of our great vets
i guess i have reached yet another ceiling with four people my highest reuters poll yet thank
why havent they released the final missouri victory for us yet could it be because cruzs guy runs missouri
just leaving salt lake city utah fantastic crowd with no interruptions love utah will be back
watching loudobbsnews fantastic show has very interesting take on paul ryan
while i have never met nytdavidbrooks of the ny times i consider him one of the dumbest of all pundits he has no sense of the real world
reading nytdavidbrooks of the ny times is a total waste of time he is a clown with no awareness of the world around him dummy
ileanabarkus nytdavidbrooks i totally agree nytdavidbrooks is strictly conceptual and theoretical and has no commonsense
realistic trump poll numbers translate to the percentile range in a twoman race gee what happened to that ceiling
actually no foxnews megynkelly has a sick obsession with trump every day every show trashing negative hate
crazy megynkelly says i dont wont go on her show and she still gets good ratings but almost all of her shows are negative hits on me
if crazy megynkelly didnt cover me so much on her terrible show her ratings would totally tank she is so average in so many ways
wow cnn ratings are up because its all trump all the time the networks are making a fortune off of me make america great again
trump is not afraid of anything or anyone thats the president usa needs to unite us knock the socks off our enemies
the rallies in utah and arizona were great tremendous crowds and spirit just returned but will be going back soon
gstephanopoulos realdonaldtrumps strategy to secure the gop nomination talk to the republican frontrunner thisweekabc
will be interviewed on thisweekabc this morning enjoy
why is it that the horrendous protesters who scream curse punch shut down roadsdoors during my rallies are never blamed by media sad
the protesters blocked a major highway yesterday delaying entry to my rally in arizona by hours and the media blames my supporters
so the highly overrated anchor megynkelly is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show but i cant fight back wrong
gamzorz megynkelly dont worry trump they are losing thousands of viewers and money roger ailes will be telling megyn to stop
big republican dinner tonight at maralago in palm beach i will be there
wow president obama just landed in cuba a big deal and raul castro wasnt even there to greet him he greeted pope and others no respect
realdonaldtrump the media is corrupt we the people are fighting with you
do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place brussels was not anymore it is from a different world us must be vigilant and smart
president obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in cuba especially in the shadows of brussels he is being treated badly
make america great again
i have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody and not even close hopefully az and ut will be voting for me today
obama and all others have been so weak and so politically correct that terror groups are forming and getting stronger shame
lyin ted cruz just used a picture of melania from a gq shoot in his ad be careful lyin ted or i will spill the beans on your wife
incompetent hillary despite the horrible attack in brussels today wants borders to be weak and openand let the muslims flow in no way
much bigger win than anticipated in arizona thank you i will never forget
hopefully the republican party can come together and have a big win in november paving the way for many great supreme court justices
lyin ted cruz denied that he had anything to do with the gq model photo post of melania thats why we call him lyin ted
ted cruz steals foreign policy from me and lines from michael just another dishonest politician
low energy jeb bush just endorsed a man he truly hates ted cruz honestly i blame jeb in that i drove him into oblivion
just watched hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror been in office fighting terror for years and look where we are
i will be the best by far in fighting terror the only one that was right from the beginning now ted others are copying me
i think having jebs endorsement hurts lyin ted jeb spent more than and got nothing i spent a fraction of that and am first
while i believe i will clinch before cleveland and get more than delegates it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race
i want to thank realsheriffjoe for all of his help in our historic arizona win could not have done it without you joe
make america great again
tcsorr realdonaldtrump selffunded and media loves him not beholden to masters like tedcruz who owns ted
realdonaldtrump donald trump will be greater president than ragan trump will set the button for moralitychristianity
nato is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on
we pay a disproportionate share of the cost of nato why it is time to renegotiate and the time is now
realdonaldtrump thank god is not a politician but hes one heck of a fighter who will fight for us the people
it is amazing how lindseygrahamsc gets on so many tv shows talking negatively about me when i beat him so badly zero in his pres run
lindseygrahamsc and lyin ted cruz are two politicians who are very much alike all talk and no action both talk about isis do nothing
these politicians like cruz and graham who have watched isis and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better
remember when i recently said that brussels is a hell hole and a mess and the failing nytimes wrote a critical article i was so right
it is amazing how often i am right only to be criticized by the media illegal immigration take the oil build the wall muslims nato
hillary clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years time for a change i will solve and fast
theview tv show which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air is constantly asking me to go on i tell them no
explain how the women on the view which is a total disaster since the great barbara walters left ever got their jobs abc is wasting time
doctorsfreud theview theyre all braindead puppets with skeletons in their closet i say you go on and destroy them all a dead show
just announced that as many as isis fighters have infiltrated europe also many in us i told you so i alone can fix this problem
europe and the us must immediately stop taking in people from syria this will be the destruction of civilization as we know it so sad
make america great
just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the trump u case but the press refuses to write about it if i lostmonster story
i didnt start the fight with lyinted cruz over the gq cover pic of melania he did he knew the pac was putting it out hence lyin ted
wow just released that million in negative ads was spent on me how am i still number one by a lot
top suspect in paris massacre salah abdeslam who also knew of the brussels attack is no longer talking weak leaders ridiculous laws
theageofleo your instincts on foreign policy terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined
dear cnn after doing a quick google twitter search there are over womens groups supporting donaldtrump stop lying
the media is so after me on women wow this is a tough business nobody has more respect for women than donald trump
the press is going out of their way to convince people that i do not like or respect women when they know that it is just the opposite
lyin ted cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with the national enqwere caused by me i had nothing to do with story
nobody will protect our nation like donald j trump our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong illegals out
wisconsins economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in us jobs are leaving i will make our economy strong again bring in jobs

lyin ted cruz cant win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bossesi am millions of votes ahead hillary would destroy him k
kasich only looks ok in polls against hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed zero negative ads against him
ted cruz even voted against superstorm sandy aid and september help so many new yorkers devastated cruz hates new york

senator ted cruz has been mathematically eliminated from race he said kasich should get out for same reason i think both should get out

i am happy to hear how badly the nytimes is doing it is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down becoming irrelevant
wow just announced that lyin ted and kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the republican nomination desperation
lyin ted and kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate their donors special interest groups are not happy with them sad
lyin ted cruz and for kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up collusion in a two on one shows weakness
shows how weak and desperate lyin ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly cant stand him and is only win and losses
kasich just announced that he wants the people of indiana to vote for him typical politician cant make a deal work
on the way to the great state of rhode island big rally then to pennsylvania for rest of day and night
the cruzkasich pact is under great strain this joke of a deal is falling apart not being honored and almost dead very dumb

governor rick perry said donald trump is one of the most talented people running for the presidency ive ever seen thank you rick
paul ryan said that i inherited something very special the republican party wrong i didnt inherit it i won it with millions of voters
crooked hillary has zero leadership ability as bernie sanders says she has bad judgement constantly playing the womens card it is sad
thank you to teachers across america when i become potus we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now
joe scarborough initially endorsed jeb bush and jeb crashed then john kasich and that didnt work not much power or insight
i hear joenbc of rapidly fading morningjoe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run this will guarantee a crooked hillary win
i hope corrupt hillary clinton chooses goofy elizabeth warren as her running mate i will defeat them both
properly check goofy elizabeth records to see if she is native american i say a fraud
goofy elizabeth warren hillary flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie she is not native american
just met with courageous family of sarah root in nebraska sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy
crooked hillary clinton wants completely open borders millions of democrats will run from her over this and support me
goofy elizabeth warren and her phony native american heritage are on a twitter rant she is too easy im driving her nuts
goofy elizabeth warren is weak and ineffective does nothing all talk no action maybe her native american name
i am going to keep our jobs in the us and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure crooked hillary has no clue teamsters
i am honored that the great men and women of the teamsters have created a movement from within called teamsters for trump thank you

daybastrop foxandfriends bretbaier the liars that signed the pledge and now wont support realdonaldtrump is the reason they are losers
valdostamonkey chriscuomo realdonaldtrump is chris serious lying or misinformed bill clinton signed nafta
crooked hillary clinton says that she got more primary votes than donald trump but i had people to had one
if i only had person running against me in the primaries like hillary clinton i would have gotten million more votes than she did
i will have set the all time record in primary votes in the republican party despite having to compete against other people
i am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate any negotiated increase by congress to my proposal would still be lower than current
get out and vote west virginia we will make america great again
get out and vote nebraska we will make america great again
why does the media with a strong push from crooked hillary keep pushing the false narrative that i want to raise taxes exactly opposite
it was rosie odonnell who ate the cake in the vicious hillary commercial about me not crooked hillary marthamaccallum
it is only the people that were never asked to be vp that tell the press that they will not take the position
i look very much forward to meeting wpaul ryan the gop party leadership on thurs in dc together we will beat the dems at all levels
it was so great being in nebraska last week today is the big dayget out and vote
the clintons spend millions on negative ads on me i tell the truth about her husband feel sorry for crooked hillary
big wins in west virginia and nebraska get ready for november crooked hillary who is looking very bad against crazy bernie will lose
i dont want to hit crazy bernie sanders too hard yet because i love watching what he is doing to crooked hillary his time will come
goofy elizabeth warren has been one of the least effective senators in the entire us senate she has done nothing
goofy elizabeth warren have the guts to run for potus her phony native american heritage stops that and vp cold
if the people of massachusetts found out what an ineffective senator goofy elizabeth warren has been she would lose
goofy elizabeth warren is now using the card like her friend crooked hillary see her dumb tweet a woman stands up to
our native american senator goofy elizabeth warren care less about the american nothing to help
goofy elizabeth warren lied when she says i want to abolish the federal minimum wage see for increase
it funny when a failed senator like goofy elizabeth warren can spend a whole day tweeting about trump gets nothing done in senate
in interview i told ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete not after election
if it were up to goofy elizabeth warren have no jobs in have a clue
senator lindsey graham called me yesterday very much to my surprise and we had a very interesting talk about national security and more
thehill your story about me the carbon tax is absolutely is just the opposite i will not support or endorse a carbon tax
if crooked hillary clinton cant close the deal on crazy bernie how is she going to take on china russia isis and all of the others
great new poll thank youpictwittercomytzesbczas
wow cnn is really working hard to make me look as bad as possible very unprofessional hurting in ratings bad television
thank you for the nice words this morning kellyriddell well delivered and totally logical cnn foxnews
the failing nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me all are impressed with how nicely i have treated women they found nothing a joke
queencharlotteo realdonaldtrump nytimes im a women i support realdonaldtrump i have since the beginning thank you
mrtohney leicester donaldtrump seem to have the same trajectory both were written off but they keep scaling the heights history
everyone is laughing at the nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and womeni gave them many names of women i helpedrefused to use
realdonaldtrump nytimes everyone continues to pile onto donald but they can never take away our votes thank you
why doesnt the failing nytimes write the real story on the clintons and women the media is totally dishonest
wow i have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing nytimes piece massive front page for that
why did the failing nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that i was so proud to have helped with their careers dishonest
the media is really on a witchhunt against me false reporting and plenty of it but we will prevail
the washingtonpost report on potential vp candidates is wrong marco rubio and most others mentioned are not under consideration
bernie sanders is being treated very badly by the dems the system is rigged against him he should run as an independent run bernie run
that was an amazing interview on foxandfriends i hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the nytimes is
the nytimes is so dishonest their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by rowanne brewer who said it was a lie
wow rowanne brewer the most prominently depicted woman in the failing nytimes story yesterday was on foxandfriends saying times lied
a political commentator for cnn which i no longer watch said trump showed some weakness in the repub primaries i set alltime record
with the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing nytimes hit piece on me we have exposed the article as a fraud
the failing nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women
no wonder the nytimes is can believe what they write after the false malicious libelous story they did on me
over women were interviewed by the nytimes yet they only wrote about because there were so many positive statements
the writer of the now proven false story in the nytimes michael barbaro who was interviewed on cbs this morning was unable to respond
in politics and in life ignorance is not a virtue this is a primary reason that president obama is the worst president in us history
i gave a woman named barbara res a top ny construction job when that was unheard of and now she is nasty so much for a nice thank you
what barbara res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly and for years trying to come back i said no
wow emails were deleted by crooked hillary clinton she said they had to do with a wedding reception liar how can she run
the pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line you can tell them to go blank themselves was about china not women
crooked hillary clinton put out an ad where i am misquoted on women cant believe she would misrepresent the facts my hit was on china
oregon is voting today keep the big numbers going vote trump make america great again
amazing that crooked hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the worst abuser of woman in us political history
crooked hillary cant close the deal with bernie sanders will be another bad day for her
crooked hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economyif so he should runnot herwill he bring the energizer to dc
how can crooked hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for nafta the worst economic deal in us history
i look forward to watching megynkelly tonight pm et it will be interesting to see how she treats think she will be very fair
i will be live tweeting my interview with megynkelly on the fox network tonight at enjoypictwittercomnljsszeiwm

michaelfavreau realdonaldtrump he will destroy hillary but why give cnn record breaking ratings cnn can go to hell trump

looks like yet another terrorist attack airplane departed from paris when will we get tough smart and vigilant great hate and sickness
how quality a woman is rowanne brewer lane to have exposed the nytimes as a disgusting fraud thank you rowanne
i said that crooked hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because she has very bad judgement bernie said the same thing
crooked hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina isis china russia and all would love for her to be president more years
look where the world is today a total mess and isis is still running around wild i can fix it fast hillary has no chance
crooked hillary clinton looks presidential i dont think so four more years of obama and our country will never come back isis laughs
crooked hillary cant even close the deal with bernie and the dems have it rigged in favor of hillary four more years of this no way

crooked hillary said that i want guns brought into the school classroom wrong
hillary clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad would be four more years of stupidity
why do the networks continue to put dopey billkristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for yrs
how can crooked hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical islam which horribly oppresses women
crooked hillary wants a radical increase in syrian refugees we allow this time to get smart and protect america

the abc poll sample is heavy on democrats very dishonest why would they do that other polls good

hillary clinton is not a change agent just the same old status quo she is spending a fortune i am spending very little close in polls
crooked hillary clinton got brexit wrong i said leave will win she has no sense of markets and such bad judgement only a question of time
the dirty poll done by abc washingtonpost is a disgrace even they admit that many more democrats were polled other polls were good

on saturday a great man elie wiesel passed awaythe world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil
the system is rigged
does anybody really believe that bill clinton and the usag talked only about grandkids and golf for minutes in plane on tarmac
the secret meeting between bill clinton and the usag in back of closed plane was heightened with fbi shouting go away no pictures
i believe that crooked hillary sent bill to have the meeting with the usag so bill is not in trouble with h except that he got caught
in bangladesh hostages were immediately killed by isis terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the koran were killed
the third mass attack slaughter in days by isis dead in baghdad worst in many years we do not have leadership that can stop this

i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren sometimes referred to as pocahontas as her vp then we can litigate her fraud
if goofy elizabeth warren a very weak senator didnt lie about her heritage being native american she would be nothing today pick her h
foxnews is much better and far more truthful than cnn which is all negative guests are stacked for crooked hillary i dont watch
the ratings at foxnews blow away the ratings of cnn not even close thats because cnn is the clinton news network and people dont like
we are trying to fight isis and now our own people are killing our police our country is divided and out of control the world is watching
i will be on tonight at pm with mike pence talking about law and order and many other subjects bad times for divided usa
our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching we are not looking good we are not looking smart we are not looking tough
president obama just had a news conference but he doesnt have a clue our country is a divided crime scene and it will only get worse
looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife melania place looks beautiful
cnn is the worstthey go to their dumb onesided panels when a podium speaker is for trump vast majority want make america great again
networks other than low ratings cnn have been very fair and exciting
roxanetancredi democrats are coming to trump i used to be proud of the dem party no more it is crooked and not for the people
the roll call is beginning at the republican national convention very exciting
such a great honor to be the republican nominee for president of the united states i will work hard and never let you down america first
congratulations to my children don and tiffany on having done a fantastic job last night i am very proud of you
bill hemmer of foxnews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena more than in past years
in november i think the people of ohio will remember that the republicans picked cleveland instead of going to another state jobs
good news is melanias speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press
the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melanias speech than the fbi spent on hillarys emails
john kasich was never asked by me to be vp just arrived in cleveland will be a great two days
thank you to governor scottwalker for such warm support great speech
wow ted cruz got booed off the stage didnt honor the pledge i saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway no big deal
mikepence was fantastic tonight will be a great vp
arena was packed totally electric
make america great
i am soooo proud of my children don eric and tiffany their speeches under enormous pressure were incredible ivanka intros me tonight
ted cruz talks about the constitution but doesnt say that if the dems win the presidency the new justices appointed will destroy us all
other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses the party is very united great love in the arena
what a great four days in cleveland so proud of the great job done by the rnc and all the police and secret service were fantastic
thank you cleveland we love you and will be back many times
one of the best produced including the incredible stage set in the history of conventions great unity big tv ratings karlrove
another attack this time in germany many killed god bless the people of munich
is it the same kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while governor of virginia and didnt get indicted while bob m did
i highly recommend the just out book the field of fight by general michael flynn how to defeat radical islam
the bernie sanders supporters are furious with the choice of tim kaine who represents the opposite of what bernie stands for philly fight
tim kaine is and always has been owned by the banks bernie supporters are outraged was their last choice bernie fought for nothing
pocahontas wanted vp slot so badly but wasnt chosen because she has done nothing in the senate also crooked hillary hates her
leaked emails of dnc show plans to destroy bernie sanders mock his heritage and much more online from wikileakes really vicious rigged
crooked hillary clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in pennsylvania against steelworkers and miners husband signed nafta
funny that the democrats would have their convention in pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs i will bring jobs back
tim kaine has been praising the trans pacific partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved job killer
i will bring jobs back and get wages up people havent had a real wage increase in almost twenty years clinton killed jobs
just saw crooked hillary and tim kaine together isis and our other enemies are drooling they dont look presidential to me
the wikileaks email release today was so bad to sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her unless he is a fraud
thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on thursday night from the heart
nancynielsenn realdonaldtrump dinesh dsousa hillarys america see it
the crooked hillary vp choice is very disrespectful to bernie sanders and all of his supporters just another case of bad judgement by h
bernie sanders started off strong but with the selection of kaine for vp is ending really weak so much for a movement total disrespect
wow president obamas brother malik just announced that he is voting for me was probably treated badly by presidentlike everybody else
looks like the bernie people will fight if not their blood sweat and tears was a total waste of time kaine stands for opposite
an analysis showed that bernie sanders would have won the democratic nomination if it were not for the super delegates
there is no longer a bernie sanders political revolution he is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end
sorry folks but bernie sanders is exhausted just cant go on any longer he is trying to dismiss the new emails and dnc disrespect sad
today proves what i have always known that reince priebus is the tough one and the smart one not debbie wasserman shultz dwstweets
i always said that debbie wasserman schultz was overrated the dems convention is cracking up and bernie is exhausted no energy left
the cnn panels are so one sided almost all against trump foxnews is so much better and the ratings are much higher dont watch cnn
if the republican convention had blown up with emails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player bernie media would go wild
crooked hillary clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top dws too bad bernie flamed out
even though bernie sanders has lost his energy and his strength i dont believe that his supporters will let crooked hillary off the hook
the democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing emails say the rigged system is alive well
the highly neurotic debbie wasserman schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a crooked hillary victory shes out
the ratings for the republican national convention were very good but for the final night my speech great thank you
watched crooked hillary clinton and tim kaine on minutes no way they are going to fix americas problems isis all others laughing
the new joke in town is that russia leaked the disastrous dnc emails which should never have been written stupid because putin likes me
how much bad judgement was on display by the people in dnc in writing those really dumb emails using even religion against bernie
hillary was involved in the email scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened
if bernie sanders after seeing the just released emails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same
crooked hillary clinton knew everything that her servant was doing at the dnc they just got caught thats all they laughed at bernie
here we go again with another clinton scandal and emails yet can you believe crooked hillary knew the fix was in b never had a chance
wow the republican convention went so smoothly compared to the dems total mess but fear not the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn
the state of florida is so embarrassed by the antics of crooked hillary clinton and debbie wasserman schultz that they will vote for change
clinton betrayed bernie voters kaine supports tpp is in pocket of wall street and backed iraq war
while bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers
hard to believe that bernie sanders has done such a complete fold he got nothing for all of the time energy and money the vp a joke
i was at foxnews and met juan williams in passing he asked if he could have pictures taken with me i said fine he then trashes on air
if cory booker is the future of the democratic party they have no future i know more about cory than he knows about himself
sad to watch bernie sanders abandon his revolution we welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs
elizabeth warren often referred to as pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about crooked hillary who she always hated
bernie sanders totally sold out to crooked hillary clinton all of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it waste of time
funny if you listen to foxnews the democrats did not have a good day if you listen to the other two they are fawning what a difference
why arent the democrats speaking about isis bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order the republican convention was great
pocahontas bombed last night sad to watch
the invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for crooked hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar
bernies exhausted he just wants to shut down and go home to bed
dems dont want to talk isis bc hillarys foreign interventions unleashed isis her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here
in order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the wikileakes disaster the dems said maybe it is russia dealing with trump crazy
for the record i have zero investments in russia
you have no idea what my strategy on isis is and neither does isis a good thing please get your facts straight thanks megynkelly
no matter what bill clinton says and no matter how well he says it the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible highly overrated
i hate to say it but the republican convention was far more interesting with a much more beautiful set than the democratic convention
many of bernies supporters have left the arena did bernie go home and go to sleep
as i have been saying crooked hillary will approve the job killing tpp after the election despite her statements to the contrary top adv
funny how the failing nytimes is pushing dems narrative that russia is working for me because putin said trump is a genius america
the democratic convention has paid zero respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country no recognition sad
hopefully the violent and vicious killing by isis of a beloved french priest is causing people to start thinking rationally get tough
crooked hillary clinton wants to flood our country with syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about the danger is massive no
our not very bright vice president joe biden just stated that i wanted to carpet bomb the enemy sorry joe that was ted cruz
not one american flag on the massive stage at the democratic national convention until people started complainingthen a small one pathetic
if russia or any other country or person has hillary clintons illegally deleted emails perhaps they should share them with the fbi
shooting deaths of police officers up this year we must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers
our country does not feel great already to the millions of wonderful people living in poverty violence and despair
realdonaldtrump davidwohl stay the course mr trump your message is resonating with the people
a vote for clintonkaine is a vote for tpp nafta high taxes radical regulation and massive influx of refugees
median household income is down for the middle class since obama took office it will only go further down under clinton
departing now thank you cedar rapids iowa this is a movementpictwittercomezrqvqptta
hillarys refusal to mention radical islam as she pushes a increase in refugees is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country
our way of life is under threat by radical islam and hillary clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words
hillary will never reform wall street she is owned by wall street
hillarys vision is a borderless world where working people have no power no jobs no safety
hillarys wars in the middle east have unleashed destruction terrorism and isis across the world
no one has worse judgement than hillary clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes
the media coverage this morning of the very average clinton speech and convention is a joke cnn and the little watched morningjoe sad
crooked hillary clinton made up facts about me and forgot to mention the many problems of our country in her very average scream
two policemen just shot in san diego one dead it is only getting worse people want law and order
anncoulter i believe in science dem code for were shutting down coal mines steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing
crooked hillary clinton mentioned me times in her very long and very boring speech many of her statements were lies and fabrications
little michael bloomberg who never had the guts to run for president knows nothing about me his last term as mayor was a disaster
crooked hillary said that i couldnt handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign reallyi just beat people and am beating her
the dishonest media didnt mention that bernie sanders was very angry looking during crookeds speech he wishes he didnt make that deal
wow my campaign is hearing from more and more bernie supporters that they will never support crooked hillary she sold them out vp pick
i am watching crooked hillary speak same old stuff our country needs change
what bernie sanders really thinks of crooked hillary clintonpictwittercomvgmaaszbep
hillary clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement insticts
as usual hillary the dems are trying to rig the debates so are up against major nfl games same as last time w bernie unacceptable
colorado was amazing yesterday so much support our tax trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to colorado and the whole country
hillary can never win over bernie supporters her foreign wars naftatpp support wall street ties are driving away millions of votes
we are suffering through the worst longterm unemployment in the last years i want change crooked hillary clinton does not
american homeownership rate in was lowest rate in we will bring back the american
just got back from colorado the love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible big crowds
violent crime is rising across the united states yet the dnc convention ignored it crime reduction will be one of my top priorities
crooked hillary clinton is soft on crime supports open borders and wants massive tax hikes a formula for disaster
why doesnt the media want to report that on the two big thursdays when crooked hillary and i made our speeches republicans won ratings
i turned down a meeting with charles and david koch much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics they will do much better
word is that crooked hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in pennsylvania perhaps it is because her husband signed nafta
crookeds stop in johnstown pennsylvania where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians drew less than with bill vp
the rust belt was created by politicians like the clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like mexico end
wow natos top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must pay their bills this is a general i will like
can you imagine if i had the small crowds that hillary is drawing today in pennsylvania it would be a major media event cnn foxnews
nielson media research final numbers on acceptance speech trump million clinton million thank you
captain khan killed years ago was a hero but this is about radical islamic terror and the weakness of our leaders to eradicate it
i was viciously attacked by mr khan at the democratic convention am i not allowed to respond hillary voted for the iraq war not me
the dishonest media is fawning over the democratic convention i wonder why then my speech had millions of more viewers than crooked h
wow it is unbelievable how distorted onesided and biased the media is against us the failing nytimes is a joke cnn is laughable
mr khan who does not know me viciously attacked me from the stage of the dnc and is now all over tv doing the same nice
this story is not about mr khan who is all over the place doing interviews but rather radical islamic terrorism and the us get smart
when i said in an interview that putin is not going into ukraine you can mark it down i am saying if i am president already in crimea
so with all of the obama tough talk on russia and the ukraine they have already taken crimea and continue to push thats what i said
cnn will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for hillary clinton
cnn anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs
when will we see stories from cnn on clinton foundation corruption and hillarys payforplay at state department
will cnn send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding or are they worried it will hurt hillary
the people who support hillary sit behind cnn anchor chairs or headline fundraisers those disconnected from real life
people believe cnn these days almost as little as they believe hillarythats really saying something
hillary clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays refuses to speak out against radical islam
when will cnn do a segment on plan to increase syrian refugees and how much it will cost
thanks to pnehlen for your kind words very much appreciated
vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in pennsylvania have moved to mexico and other countries that will end when i win

our incompetent secretary of state hillary clinton was the one who started talks to give million dollars in cash to iran scandal
president obama should ask the dnc about how they rigged the election against bernie
obamas disastrous judgment gave us isis rise of iran and the worst economic numbers since the great depression
the plane i saw on television was the hostage plane in geneva switzerland not the plane carrying million in cash going to iran
hillary clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions let us all see what happens
crooked hillary said loudly and for the world to see that she short circuited when answering a question on her emails very dangerous
anybody whose mind short circuits is not fit to be our president look up the word brainwashed
heading to new hampshire will be talking about hillary saying her brain short circuited and other things
i am not just running against crooked hillary clinton i am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media but i will win

were all enjoying you as well mr t youve inspired hope and a positive spirit throughout america god bless you nice
the failing nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened their reporting is fiction the media protects hillary
the failing nytimes which never spoke to me keeps saying that i am saying to advisers that i will change false i am who i amnever said
if the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didnt put false meaning into the words i say i would be beating hillary by
my rallies are not covered properly by the media they never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm
crooked hillary clinton is being protected by the media she is not a talented person or politician the dishonest media refuses to expose
i am not only fighting crooked hillary i am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process people get it
it is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false
i have always been the same personremain true to selfthe media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so
stay on message is the chant i always do trade jobs military vets a repeal ocare borders etc but media misrepresents
certain republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the ussupreme court get proper appointments sad

wow crooked hillary was duped and used by my worst miss u hillary floated her as an angel without checking her past which is terrible
using alicia m in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that crooked hillary suffers from bad judgement hillary was set up by a con
did crooked hillary help disgusting check out sex tape and past alicia m become a us citizen so she could use her in the debate
remember dont believe sources said by the very dishonest media if they dont name the sources the sources dont exist
the people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the dallas arizona papers now usa today will lose readers the people get it

we agree potus shell hillary clinton say anything change nothing its time to turn the page president obama
thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night very exciting
paul ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting republican nominee
wow cnn got caught fixing their focus group in order to make crooked hillary look better really pathetic and totally dishonest
is this really america
despite winning the second debate in a landslide every poll it is hard to do well when paul ryan and others give zero support
our very weak and ineffective leader paul ryan had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty
it is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and i can now fight for america the way i want to
with the exception of cheating bernie out of the nom the dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the republicans
disloyal rs are far more difficult than crooked hillary they come at you from all sides they know how to win i will teach them
the very foul mouthed sen john mccain begged for my support during his primary i gave he won then dropped me over locker room remarks
in texas now leaving soon for big rally in florida
i hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of hillary clinton as exposed by wikileaks she is unfit to run
dont let her fool us
wow cnn town hall questions were given to crooked hillary clinton in advance of big debates against bernie sanders hillary cnn fraud
crooked hillary clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for years why didnt she do them
very little pickup by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by wikileaks so dishonest rigged system
the people of cuba have struggled too long will reverse obamas executive orders and concessions towards cuba until freedoms are restored
why didnt the writer of the twelve year old article in people magazine mention the incident in her story because it did not happen

the election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing crooked hillary but also at many polling places sad
the democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked hillary clinton we have paul ryan always fighting the republican nominee
paul ryan a man who doesnt know how to win including failed run four years ago must start focusing on the budget military vets etc

voter fraud crooked hillary clinton even got the questions to a debate and nobody says a word can you imagine if i got the questions

fidel castro is dead
the green party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated demoralized dems
the democrats when they incorrectly thought they were going to win asked that the election night tabulation be accepted not so anymore
hillary clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in nothing will change
hillarys debate answer on delay that is horrifying that is not the way our democracy works been around for years weve had free
and fair elections weve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a
during a general election i for one am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind
of position then separately she stated he said something truly horrifying he refused to say that he would respect the results of
this election that is a direct threat to our democracy she then said we have to accept the results and look to the future donald
trump is going to be our president we owe him an open mind and the chance to lead so much time and money will be spent same result sad
in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally
it would have been much easier for me to win the socalled popular vote than the electoral college in that i would only campaign in or
states instead of the states that i visited i would have won even more easily and convincingly but smaller states are forgotten

i thought that cnn would get better after they failed so badly in their support of hillary clinton however since election they are worse

these companies are able to move between all states with no tax or tariff being charged please be forewarned prior to making a very
expensive mistake the united states is open for business

the media tries so hard to make my move to the white house as it pertains to my business so complex when actually it isnt
if russia or some other entity was hacking why did the white house wait so long to act why did they only complain after hillary lost

today there were terror attacks in turkey switzerland and germany and it is only getting worse the civilized world must change thinking
we did it thank you to all of my great supporters we just officially won the election despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media
franklingraham congratulations to presidentelect realdonaldtrumpthe electoral votes are in and its official thank you franklin
mikepence congratulations to realdonaldtrump officially elected president of the united states today by the electoral college
bill clinton stated that i called him after the election wrong he called me with a very nice congratulations he doesnt know much
especially how to get people even with an unlimited budget out to vote in the vital swing states and more they focused on wrong states
yes it is true carlos slim the great businessman from mexico called me about getting together for a meeting we met he is a great guy
campaigning to win the electoral college is much more difficult sophisticated than the popular vote hillary focused on the wrong states
i would have done even better in the election if that is possible if the winner was based on popular vote but would campaign differently
i have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that i spent far less money on the win than hillary on the loss
i met some really great air force generals and navy admirals today talking about airplane capability and pricing very impressive people
someone incorrectly stated that the phrase drain the swamp was no longer being used by me actually we will always be trying to dts

nbcnews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes dishonest
the big loss yesterday for israel in the united nations will make it much harder to negotiate peacetoo bad but we will get it done anyway
merry christmas and a very very very very happy new year to everyone
president obama said that he thinks he would have won against me he should say that but i say no way jobs leaving isis ocare etc
the united nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together talk and have a good time so sad
the world was gloomy before i won there was no hope now the market is up nearly and christmas spending is over a trillion dollars
i gave millions of dollars to djt foundation raised or recieved millions more all of which is given to charity and media wont report
the djt foundation unlike most foundations never paid fees rent salaries or any expenses of money goes to wonderful charities
president obama campaigned hard and personally in the very important swing states and lostthe voters wanted to make america great again
the us consumer confidence index for december surged nearly four points to the highest level in more than years thanks donald
doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory president o statements and roadblocksthought it was going to be a smooth transition not

not anymore the beginning of the end was the horrible iran deal and now this un stay strong israel january is fast approaching
great move on delay by v putin i always knew he was very smart
russians are playing cnn and nbcnews for such fools funny to watch they dont have a clue foxnews totally gets it
happy new year to all including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just dont know what to do love
well the new year begins we will together make america great again
chicago murder rate is record setting shooting victims with murders in if mayor cant do it he must ask for federal help
cnn just released a book called unprecedented which explores the race victory hope it does well but used worst cover photo of me

i thought and felt i would win big easily over the fabled when they cancelled fireworks they knew and so did i
north korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the us it wont happen

general motors is sending mexican made model of chevy cruze to us car dealerstax free across border make in usaor pay big border tax
people must remember that obamacare just doesnt work and it is not affordable increases arizona bill clinton called it crazy
the democrat governorof minnesota said the affordable care act obamacare is no longer affordable and it is lousy healthcare
with all that congress has to work on do they really have to make the weakening of the independent ethics watchdog as unfair as it
there should be no further releases from gitmo these are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield
i will be having a general news conference on january eleventh in nyc thank you
the intelligence briefing on socalled russian hacking was delayed until friday perhaps more time needed to build a case very strange
julian assange said a year old could have hacked podesta why was dnc so careless also said russians did not give him the info
thank you to ford for scrapping a new plant in mexico and creating new jobs in the us this is just the beginning much more to follow
somebody hacked the dnc but why did they not have hacking defense like the rnc has and why have they not responded to the terrible
things they did and said like giving the questions to the debate to h a total double standard media as usual gave them a pass
republicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster with its poor coverage and massive premium increases
like the hike in arizona also deductibles are so high that it is practically useless dont let the schumer clowns out of this web
massive increases of obamacare will take place this year and dems are to blame for the mess it will fall of its own weight be careful
jackie evanchos album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her inauguration performancesome people just dont understand the movement
the democrats lead by head clown chuck schumer know how bad obamacare is and what a mess they are in instead of working to fix it they
do the typical political thing and blame the fact is obamacare was a lie from the beginningkeep you doctor keep your plan it is
time for republicans democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive far better
the dishonest media likes saying that i am in agreement with julian assange wrong i simply state what he states it is for the people
to make up their own minds as to the truth the media lies to make it look like i am against intelligence when in fact i am a big fan
toyota motor said will build a new plant in baja mexico to build corolla cars for us no way build plant in us or pay big border tax
how did nbc get an exclusive look into the top secret report he obama was presented who gave them this report and why politics
the democratic national committee would not allow the fbi to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by russia
so how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers what is going on
the dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the great wall for sake of speed will be paid back by mexico later
hillary and the dems were never going to beat the passion of my voters they saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the
and knew they were in big trouble which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minutethey saw a movement like never before
hopefully all supporters and those who want to make america great again will go to dc on january it will be a great show

i am asking the chairs of the house and senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with nbc prior to me seeing it
monitoring the terrible situation in florida just spoke to governor scott thoughts and prayers for all stay safe
gross negligence by the democratic national committee allowed hacking to take placethe republican national committee had strong defense
intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results voting machines not touched
only reason the hacking of the poorly defended dnc is discussed is that the loss by the dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed
having a good relationship with russia is a good thing not a bad thing only stupid people or fools would think that it is bad we
have enough problems around the world without yet another one when i am president russia will respect us far more than they do now and
both countries will perhaps work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the world

is it legal for a sitting president to be wire tapping a race for president prior to an election turned down by court earlier a new low

remember when the failing nytimes apologized to its subscribers right after the election because their coverage was so wrong now worse
if the people of our great country could only see how viciously and inaccurately my administration is covered by certain media
the freedom caucus will hurt the entire republican agenda if they dont get on the team fast we must fight them dems in
if repmarkmeadows jimjordan and raullabrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts reform

the failing nytimes finally gets it in places where no insurance company offers plans there will be no way for obamacare customers to
use subsidies to buy health plans in other words ocare is dead good things will happen however either with republicans or dems

talks on repealing and replacing obamacare are and have been going on and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck
the real story turns out to be surveillance and leaking find the leakers
such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by foxandfriends spied on before nomination the real story
was the brother of john podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on russia lifted did hillary know
did hillary clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate just asking
foxnews from multiple sources there was electronic surveillance of trump and people close to trump this is unprecedented fbi

obamacare is in serious trouble the dems need big money to keep it going otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought
the democrats dont want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad ms gang members
eventually but at a later date so we can get started early mexico will be paying in some form for the badly needed border wall
new polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is fake and almost always negative would still beat hillary in
popular vote abc newswashington post poll wrong big on election said almost all stand by their vote on me said strong leader
the two fake news polls released yesterday abc nbc while containing some very positive info were totally wrong in general e watch
the wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth and many others if
if our healthcare plan is approved you will see real healthcare and premiums will start tumbling down obamacare is in a death spiral
canada has made business for our dairy farmers in wisconsin and other border states very difficult we will not stand for this watch
dont let the fake media tell you that i have changed my position on the wall it will get built and help stop drugs human trafficking etc
first the ninth circuit rules against the ban now it hits again on sanctuary citiesboth ridiculous rulings see you in the supreme court
out of our very big country with many choices does everyone notice that both the ban case and now the sanctuary case is brought in
the ninth circuit which has a terrible record of being overturned close to they used to call this judge shopping messy system
the us recorded its slowest economic growth in five years gdp up only trade deficits hurt the economy very badly
a great great honor to welcome recognize the national teacher of the year as well as the teacher of the year from each state
i received calls from the president of mexico and the prime minister of canada asking to renegotiate nafta rather than terminate i agreed
subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all we will then terminate nafta relationships are gooddeal very possible
the democrats want to shut government if we dont bail out puerto rico and give billions to their insurance companies for ocare failure no
i want to help our miners while the democrats are blocking their healthcare
i promise to rebuild our military and secure our border democrats want to shut down the government politics
whats more important rebuilding our military or bailing out insurance companies ask the democrats
democrats used to support border security now they want illegals to pour through our borders
as families prepare for summer vacations in our national parks democrats threaten to close them and shut down the government terrible

big excitement last night in the great state of pennsylvania fantastic crowd and people make america great again
the democrats without a leader have become the party of obstructionthey are only interested in themselves and not in whats best for us
you cant compare anything to obamacare because obamacare is dead dems want billions to go to insurance companies to bail out donorsnew
healthcare plan is on its way will have much lower premiums deductibles while at the same time taking care of preexisting conditions
president andrew jackson who died years before the civil war started saw it coming and was angry would never have let it happen
the reason for the plan negotiated between the republicans and democrats is that we need votes in the senate which are not there we
either elect more republican senators in or change the rules now to our country needs a good shutdown in september to fix mess
fbi director comey was the best thing that ever happened to hillary clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds the phony
trumprussia story was an excuse used by the democrats as justification for losing the election perhaps trump just ran a great campaign
susan rice the former national security advisor to president obama is refusing to testify before a senate subcommittee next week on
allegations of unmasking trump transition officials not good
the fake news media is officially out of control they will do or say anything in order to get attention never been a time like this
congratulations to foxandfriends on its unbelievable ratings hike
i am watching the democrats trying to defend the you can keep you doctor you can keep your plan premiums will go down obamacare lie
insurance companies are fleeing obamacare it is dead our healthcare plan will lower premiums deductibles and be great healthcare
if victorious republicans will be having a big press conference at the beautiful rose garden of the white house immediately after vote

big win in the house very exciting but when everything comes together with the inclusion of phase we will have truly great healthcare
rather than causing a big disruption in nyc i will be working out of my home in bedminster nj this weekend also saves country money
of course the australians have better healthcare than we do everybody does obamacare is dead but our healthcare will soon be great
jobs jobs
wowthe fake news media did everything in its power to make the republican healthcare victory look as bad as possiblefar better than ocare
why is it that the fake news rarely reports ocare is on its last legs and that insurance companies are fleeing for their lives its dead
great jobs report today it is all beginning to work
the reason i am staying in bedminster n j a beautiful community is that staying in nyc is much more expensive and disruptive meetings
when will the fake media ask about the dems dealings with russia why the dnc wouldnt allow the fbi to check their server or investigate
republican senators will not let the american people down obamacare premiums and deductibles are way up it was a lie and it is dead
congratulations to emmanuel macron on his big win today as the next president of france i look very much forward to working with him
rexnord of indiana made a deal during the obama administration to move to mexico fired their employees tax product big thats sold in us

ask sally yates under oath if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to wh counsel
director clapper reiterated what everybody including the fake media already knows there is no evidence of collusion w russia and trump
sally yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today she said nothing but old news
the russiatrump collusion story is a total hoax when will this taxpayer funded charade end
the democrats have said some of the worst things about james comey including the fact that he should be fired but now they play so sad
james comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job bringing back the spirit and prestige of the fbi
comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in washington republican and democrat alike when things calm down they will be thanking me
watching senator richard blumenthal speak of comey is a joke richie devised one of the greatest military frauds in us history for
years as a pol in connecticut blumenthal would talk of his great bravery and conquests in vietnam except he was never there when
caught he cried like a baby and begged for forgivenessand now he is judge jury he should be the one who is investigated for his acts
the roger stone report on cnn is false fake news have not spoken to roger in a long time had nothing to do with my decision
dems have been complaining for months months about dir comey now that he has been fired they pretend to be aggrieved phony hypocrites
russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the us tears itself apart over a democrat excuse for losing the election
again the story that there was collusion between the russians trump campaign was fabricated by dems as an excuse for losing the election
the fake media is working overtime today
as a very active president with lots of things happening it is not possible for my surrogates to stand at podium with perfect accuracy
maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future press briefings and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy
james comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press
when james clapper himself and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt says there is no collusion when does it end
china just agreed that the us will be allowed to sell beef and other major products into china once again this is real news

just returned from europe trip was a great success for america hard work but big results
whenever you see the words sources say in the fake news media and they dont mention names

british prime minister may was very angry that the info the uk gave to us about manchester was leaked gave me full details
i suggest that we add more dollars to healthcare and make it the best anywhere obamacare is dead the republicans will do much better
the massive tax cutsreform that i have submitted is moving along in the process very well actually ahead of schedule big benefits to all
the fake news media works hard at disparaging demeaning my use of social media because they dont want america to hear the real story
north korea has shown great disrespect for their neighbor china by shooting off yet another ballistic missilebut china is trying hard
today we remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving thank you god bless your families god bless the usa
i look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this memorial day at arlington national cemetery later this morning
we have a massive trade deficit with germany plus they pay far less than they should on nato military very bad for us this will change
russian officials must be laughing at the us how a lame excuse for why the dems lost the election has taken over the fake news
the us senate should switch to votes immediately and get healthcare and tax cuts approved fast and easy dems would do it no doubt
who can figure out the true meaning of covfefe enjoy
so now it is reported that the democrats who have excoriated carter page about russia dont want him to testify he blows away their

we need to be smart vigilant and tough we need the courts to give us back our rights we need the travel ban as an extra level of safety
whatever the united states can do to help out in london and the u k we will be there we are with you god bless
we must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people if we dont get smart it will only get worse
at least dead and wounded in terror attack and mayor of london says there is no reason to be alarmed
do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now thats because they used knives and a truck
people the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want but i am calling it what we need and what it is a travel ban
the justice dept should have stayed with the original travel ban not the watered down politically correct version they submitted to sc
the justice dept should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down travel ban before the supreme court seek much tougher version
in any event we are extreme vetting people coming into the us in order to help keep our country safe the courts are slow and political
foxandfriends dems are taking forever to approve my people including ambassadors they are nothing but obstructionists want approvals
pathetic excuse by london mayor sadiq khan who had to think fast on his no reason to be alarmed statement msm is working hard to sell it
thats right we need a travel ban for certain dangerous countries not some politically correct term that wont help us protect our people
big meeting today with republican leadership concerning tax cuts and healthcare we are all pushing hard must get it right
the fake msm is working so hard trying to get me not to use social media they hate that i can get the honest and unfiltered message out
during my recent trip to the middle east i stated that there can no longer be funding of radical ideology leaders pointed to qatar look
sorry folks but if i would have relied on the fake news of cnn nbc abc cbs washpost or nytimes i would have had zero chance winning wh
so good to see the saudi arabia visit with the king and countries already paying off they said they would take a hard line on funding
extremism and all reference was pointing to qatar perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism

former homeland security advisor jeh johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between trump russia
by the way if russia was working so hard on the election it all took place during the obama admin why didnt they stop them
why did democratic national committee turn down the dhs offer to protect against hacks long prior to election its all a big dem hoax
why did the dnc refuse to turn over its server to the fbi and still hasnt its all a big dem scam and excuse for losing the election
i certainly hope the democrats do not force nancy p out that would be very bad for the republican party and please let cryin chuck stay

democrats slam gop healthcare proposal as obamacare premiums deductibles increase by over remember keep your doctor keep your plan
since the obama administration was told way before the election that the russians were meddling why no action focus on them not t
obama administration official said they choked when it came to acting on russian meddling of election they didnt want to hurt hillary
i cannot imagine that these very fine republican senators would allow the american people to suffer a broken obamacare any longer
make america great again
hillary clinton colluded with the democratic party in order to beat crazy bernie sanders is she allowed to so collude unfair to bernie
the democrats have become nothing but obstructionists they have no policies or ideas all they do is delay and complainthey own obamacare
the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win
and did not want to rock the boat he didnt choke he colluded or obstructed and it did the dems and crooked hillary no good
the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling with months looking at russia
under a magnifying glass they have zero tapes of t people colluding there is no collusion no obstruction i should be given apology
republican senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the democrats not easy perhaps just let ocare crash burn
very grateful for the decision from the u s supreme court we must keep america safe

republicans should just repeal failing obamacare now work on a new healthcare plan that will start from a clean slate dems will join in
we were let down by all of the democrats and a few republicans most republicans were loyal terrific worked really hard we will return
as i have always said let obamacare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan stay tuned
with only a very small majority the republicans in the house senate need more victories next year since dems totally obstruct no votes
the senate must go to a vote majority instead of current votes even parts of full repeal need dems control senate crazy
fake news story of secret dinner with putin is sick all g leaders and spouses were invited by the chancellor of germany press knew
the fake news is becoming more and more dishonest even a dinner arranged for top leaders in germany is made to look sinister

in all fairness to anthony scaramucci he wanted to endorse me before the republican primaries started but didnt think i was running
the republican senators must step up to the plate and after years vote to repeal and replace next tax reform and infrastructure win
obamacare is dead and the democrats are obstructionists no ideas or votes only obstruction it is solely up to the republican senators
as the phony russian witch hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold democrats and russians
its very sad that republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their president
its hard to read the failing new york times or the amazon washington post because every storyopinion even if should be positive is bad
if republicans dont repeal and replace the disastrous obamacare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand
thank you to loudobbs for giving the first six months of the trump administration an a screg cuttingstock m jobsborder etc true
drain the swamp should be changed to drain the sewer its actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the fake news

so why arent the committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered ag looking into crooked hillarys crimes russia relations
sleazy adam schiff the totally biased congressman looking into russia spends all of his time on television pushing the dem loss excuse
republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on repeal replace after years of talking campaigning on it
the amazon washington post fabricated the facts on my ending massive dangerous and wasteful payments to syrian rebels fighting assad
so many stories about me in the washingtonpost are fake news they are as bad as ratings challenged cnn lobbyist for amazon and taxes
is fake news washington post being used as a lobbyist weapon against congress to keep politicians from looking into amazon notax monopoly
ukrainian efforts to sabotage trump campaign quietly working to boost clinton so where is the investigation ag seanhannity
attorney general jeff sessions has taken a very weak position on hillary clinton crimes where are emails dnc server intel leakers

wow the failing nytimes said about foxandfriends the most powerful tv show in america
come on republican senators you can do it on healthcare after years this is your chance to shine dont let the american people down
one of the things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the russians collected and spread negative information
about then candidate trump catherine herridge foxnews so why doesnt fake news report this witch hunt purposely phony reporting
big progress being made in ridding our country of gang members and gang members in general make america safe again

republicans in the senate will never win if they dont go to a vote majority now they look like fools and are just wasting time
dems totally control the us senate many great republican bills will never pass like kates law and complete healthcare get smart
if the senate democrats ever got the chance they would switch to a majority vote in first minute they are laughing at rs make change
after seven years of talking repeal replace the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding obamacare
if a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly bailouts for insurance companies and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon
us stock market up almost since election
unless the republican senators are total quitters repeal replace is not dead demand another vote before voting on any other bill
i am very disappointed in china our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade yet

working hard from new jersey while white house goes through long planned renovation going to new york next week for more meetings
interesting to watch senator richard blumenthal of connecticut talking about hoax russian collusion when he was a phony vietnam con artist
never in ushistory has anyone lied or defrauded voters like senator richard blumenthal he told stories about his vietnam battles and
conquests how brave he was and it was all a lie he cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child now he judges collusion
the fake news media will not talk about the importance of the united nations security councils vote in favor of sanctions on n korea
how much longer will the failing nytimes with its big losses and massive unfunded liability and nonexistent sources remain in business
i think senator blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in vietnam where he lied about his service so he can at least say he was there
i will be holding a major briefing on the opioid crisis a major problem for our country today at pm in bedminster nj

i had to fire general flynn because he lied to the vice president and the fbi he has pled guilty to those lies it is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful there was nothing to hide
years ago this week a brave seamstress in montgomery alabama uttered one word that changed historypictwittercomeovcbcmikx
so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed while crooked hillary clinton on that now famous fbi holiday with no swearing in and no recording lies many timesand nothing happens to her rigged system or just a double standard
many people in our country are asking what the department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress deleted and emails no justice

andrew mccabe addition to his wife getting all of this money from m clinton puppet he was using allegedly his fbi official email account to promote her campaign you obviously cannot do this these were the people who were investigating hillary

many mostly democrat states refused to hand over data from the election to the commission on voter fraud they fought hard that the commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally system is rigged must go to voter id
as americans you need identification sometimes in a very strong and accurate form for almost everything you doexcept when it comes to the most important thing voting for the people that run your country push hard for voter identification

well now that collusion with russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with hillary clinton and the fbirussia the fake news media mainstream and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable they should try winning an election sad
the mercer family recently dumped the leaker known as sloppy steve bannon smart
the african american unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate in years i am so happy about this news and in the washington post of all places headline states first year jobs numbers were very very
brian ross the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the stock market down points billions of dollars was suspended for a month but is now back at abc news in a lower capacity he is no longer allowed to report on trump should have been fired
now that russian collusion after one year of intense study has proven to be a total hoax on the american public the democrats and their lapdogs the fake news mainstream media are taking out the old ronald reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence
actually throughout my life my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being like really smart crooked hillary clinton also played these cards very hard and as everyone knows went down in flames i went from very successful businessman to top tv star
to president of the united states on my first try i think that would qualify as not smart but geniusand a very stable genius at that

the fake news awards those going to the most corrupt biased of the mainstream media will be presented to the losers on wednesday january rather than this coming monday the interest in and importance of these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated
the stock market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only record setting stock prices but present and future jobs jobs jobs seven trillion dollars of value created since our big election win
is turning out to be an enormously consequential presidency so much so that despite my own frustration over his missteps there has never been a day when i wished hillary clinton were president not one indeed as accomplishments accumulate the mere thought of
in every decision we make we are honoring proud farming legacy years of crushing taxes crippling regs corrupt politics left our communities hurting our economy stagnant millions of hardworking americans completely forgotten but they are not forgotten
we are fighting for our farmers for our country and for our great american flag we want our flag respected and we want our national anthem respected
as i made very clear today our country needs the security of the wall on the southern border which must be part of any daca approval
it just shows everyone how broken and unfair our court system is when the opposing side in a case such as daca always runs to the circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts
the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trumprussia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace must have tough primary
the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues there was no collusion everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion yet on and on it goes russia the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing republicans should finally take control
cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes america the place to invest great news as toyota and mazda announce they are bringing jobs and investing billion in alabama helping to further grow our

chrysler is moving a massive plant from mexico to michigan reversing a years long opposite trend thank you chrysler a very wise decision the voters in michigan are very happy they voted for trumppence plenty of more to follow
democrat dianne feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal she blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold a first
the democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the southern border risking thousands of lives in the process it is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all americans we must build a great wall think merit and end lottery chain usa
reason i canceled my trip to london is that i am not a big fan of the obama administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in london for only to build a new one in an off location for billion dollars bad deal wanted me to cut ribbonno
the socalled bipartisan daca deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of republican senators and congressmen was a big step backwards wall was not properly funded chain lottery were made worse and usa would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime
countries which are doing badly i want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level i want safety and security for our people i want to stop the massive inflow of drugs i want to fund our military not do a dem defund
because of the democrats not being interested in life and safety daca has now taken a big step backwards the dems will threaten but what they are really doing is shutting down our military at a time we need it most get smart make america great again
the language used by me at the daca meeting was tough but this was not the language used what was really tough was the outlandish proposal made a big setback for daca
sadly democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal not a fair deal for daca take care of our military and our country first
never said anything derogatory about haitians other than haiti is obviously a very poor and troubled country never said them made up by dems i have a wonderful relationship with haitians probably should record future meetings unfortunately no trust
today it was my great honor to proclaim january as martin luther king jr federal holiday i encourage all americans to observe this day with appropriate civic community and service activities in honor of dr kings life and
yesterday was a big day for the stock market jobs are coming back to america chrysler is coming back to the usa from mexico and many others will follow tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing american business is hot again
the democrats are all talk and no action they are doing nothing to fix daca great opportunity missed too bad
america first
i believe the democrats really want to see a deal on daca they are all talk and no action this is the time but day by day they are blowing the one great opportunity they have too bad
so much fake news is being reported they even try to get it right or correct it when they are wrong they promote the fake book of a mentally deranged author who knowingly writes false information the mainstream media is crazed that we won the election
the wall street journal stated falsely that i said to them have a good relationship with kim jong of n korea obviously i say that i said have a good relationship with kim jong a big difference fortunately we now record conversations with reporters
and they knew exactly what i said and meant they just wanted a story fake news
daca is probably dead because the democrats really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our military
trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy tax cut bonuses to more than workers most explosive stock market rally that seen in modern times to from election and grounded in profitability and growth all trump not
big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all among many other things trump reversed the policies of president obama and reversed our economic thank you stuart varney foxandfriends
statement by me last night in florida i think the democrats want to make a deal they talk about daca but they want to helpwe are ready willing and able to make a deal but they want to they want security at the border they want
to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot my standard is very simple america first make america great again
senator dicky durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the daca meeting deals get made when there is no trust durbin blew daca and is hurting our military
we must have security at our very dangerous southern border and we must have a great wall to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country
the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military at a time we need it more than ever we need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now no more dangerous lottery
do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative the russian collusion hoax is dead except as it pertains to the dems public gets it
of trump news coverage was and much of it contrivedfoxandfriends

the wall is the wall it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it parts will be of necessity see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains wastelands or tough rivers or water
the wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by mexico which has a ridiculous billion dollar trade surplus with the us the billion dollar wall is compared to what mexico makes from the us nafta is a bad joke
will be going to pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to rick saccone running for congress in a special election march rick is a great guy we need more republicans to continue our already successful agenda
we need the wall for the safety and security of our country we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world if there is no wall there is no deal

view is that not only has trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the dossier and the lies about the clintondnc dossier it shows that been victimized been victimized by the obama administration who were using all sorts of

my prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible florida shooting no child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an american school
just spoke to governor rick scott we are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible florida school shooting
so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem must always report such instances to authorities again and again
while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa
the schumerroundscollins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe dhsgov says it would be end of immigration enforcement in it creates a giant amnesty including for dangerous criminals build the wall expands chain migration keeps the visa
lottery continues deadly catchandrelease and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement and a vote for open borders if dems are actually serious about daca they should support the grassley bill
i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth but people whose lives have been totally shattered am also working with congress on many fronts
cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democratstotally abandoned republicans are still working hard
russia started their antius campaign in long before i announced that i would run for president the results of the election were not impacted the trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion
melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county florida will never forget them or the evening
deal don a big written by michael goodwin of the nypost succinctly states that russians had no impact on the election there was no collusion with the trump campaign lost the oldfashioned way by being a terrible candidate case
deputy ag rod rosenstein stated at the news conference is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the election
funny how the fake news media want to say that the russian group was formed in long before my run for president maybe they knew i was going to run even though i know
just like they want to solve the daca problem why the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house senate during the obama administration because they want to and now they just talk
very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter this is not acceptable they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign there is no collusion get back to the basics and make us all proud
general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h the dnc and the dems remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the podesta company
never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress the fbi or justice called for an investigation
finally adam schiff the monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the election he is finally right about something obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing thank you adam
i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his the russian was that the trump campaign colluded with russia it never did
now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the election but i a great candidate
if it was the goal of russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the us then with all of the committee hearings investigations and party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams they are laughing their asses off in moscow get smart america
great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot big gain over last weeks i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans the cuts the dems want to take away we need more republicans

faith of donald a book just out by david brody and scott lamb is a very interesting read enjoy
thank you to foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia including crimea syria and so much more we are now starting to win again
is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig elections no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time and so invite mr trump to stop whining and make his case to get
the president obama quote just before election because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he want to the when i easily won the electoral college the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems
republicans are now leading the generic poll perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away actually they want to raise you taxes substantially also they want to do nothing on daca want to fix
matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event big difference from those days when president obama held the white house come a long way matt
hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new congressional map all the way to the supreme court if necessary your original was correct let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes waste money
i have been much tougher on russia than obama just look at the facts total fake news
a woman i know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her for two minutes yet in the lobby of trump tower years ago never happened who would do this in a public space with live security
cameras running another false accusation why washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me one had her home mortgage paid off only foxnews so fit the mainstream media narrative
bad ratings cnn msnbc got scammed when they covered the antitrump russia rally walltowall they probably knew it was fake news but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise
whether we are republican or democrat we must now focus on strengthening background checks
the great billy graham is dead there was nobody like him he will be missed by christians and all religions a very special man
question if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january why they the subject of the investigation why obama do something about the meddling why dem crimes under investigation ask jeff sessions
i never said teachers like was stated on fake news cnn nbc what i said was to look at the possibility of giving guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience only the best of teachers a lot would now be able to
immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this far more assets at much less cost than guards a school is a magnet for bad people attacks would end
history shows that a school shooting lasts on average minutes it takes police first responders approximately to minutes to get to site of crime highly trained gun adept teacherscoaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive great deterrent
if a potential knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers and others who will be instantly shooting the sicko will never attack that school cowards go thereproblem solved must be offensive defense alone work
i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health raise age to and end sale of bump stocks congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue i hope
what many people understand or want to understand is that wayne chris and the folks who work so hard at the nra are great people and great american patriots they love our country and will do the right thing make america great again

andrew mccabe fired a great day for the hard working men and women of the fbi a great day for democracy sanctimonious james comey was his boss and made mccabe look like a choirboy he knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the fbi

the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign witch hunt
wow watch comey lie under oath to senator g when asked you ever been an anonymous sourceor known someone else to be an anonymous he said strongly he lied as shown clearly on foxandfriends
spent very little time with andrew mccabe but he never took notes when he was with me i believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date same with lying james comey can we call them fake memos
why does the mueller team have hardened democrats some big crooked hillary supporters and zero republicans another dem recently addeddoes anyone think this is fair and yet there is no collusion

council is told to find crimes whether a crime exists or not i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council i am still opposed to it i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because
i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past obama called him also the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him they are wrong getting along with russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing

much can be done with the billion given to building and fixing the border wall it is just a down payment work will start immediately the rest of the money will come and remember daca the democrats abandoned you but we will not
many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on fame fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted problem is that a new
lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed if for no other reason than they can bill more which is unfair to our great country and i am very happy with my existing team besides there was no collusion with russia except by crooked hillary and the dems

i have stated my concerns with amazon long before the election unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state local governments use our postal system as their delivery boy causing tremendous loss to the us and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business
we are going to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the great state of ohio a tremendous honor to be here today at a stateoftheart training site where the skills of the american worker are forged and
washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair no more its time to rebuild and we will do it with american workers american grit and american

while we are on the subject it is reported that the us post office will lose on average for each package it delivers for amazon that amounts to billions of dollars the failing ny times reports that size of the lobbying staff has and that
does not include the fake washington post which is used as a and should so register if the po its parcel rates shipping costs would rise by this post office scam must stop amazon must pay real costs and taxes now

border patrol agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the border because of ridiculous liberal democrat laws like catch release getting more dangerous coming republicans must go to nuclear option to pass tough laws now no more daca deal
mexico is doing very little if not nothing at stopping people from flowing into mexico through their southern border and then into the us they laugh at our dumb immigration laws they must stop the big drug and people flows or i will stop their cash cow nafta need wall
these big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of daca they want in on the act
mexico has the absolute power not to let these large of people enter their country they must stop them at their northern border which they can do because their border laws work not allow them to pass through into our country which has no effective border laws
congress must immediately pass border legislation use nuclear option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people border patrol agents and ice are great but the weak dem laws allow them to do their job act now congress our country is being stolen
daca is dead because the democrats care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon no longer works must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation democrats want no borders hence drugs and crime
mexico is making a fortune on naftathey have very strong border laws ours are pathetic with all of the money they make from the us hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours at least until congress changes our immigration laws
so funny to watch fake news networks among the most dishonest groups of people i have ever dealt with criticize sinclair broadcasting for being biased sinclair is far superior to cnn and even more fake nbc which is a total joke
only fools or worse are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon they lose a fortune and this will be changed also our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the countrynot a level playing field
so sad that the department of and the fbi are slow walking or even not giving the unredacted documents requested by congress an embarrassment to our country
an honor to host the annual whitehouse easter egg

trumps approval rate among likely us voters hit percent on monday which puts him higher than former president barack obamas score at the same point into his first term according to a new via annagiaritelli dcexaminerpictwittercomzzycnodcqj
the fake news networks those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast the at cnn nbc abc cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction
the big caravan of people from honduras now coming across mexico and heading to our border had better be stopped before it gets there cash cow nafta is in play as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen congress must act now
check out the fact that you get a job at ratings challenged cnn unless you state that you are totally antitrump little jeff zuker whose job is in jeopardy is not having much fun lately they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting
thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling just hit which is higher than obama at the same time in his administration

the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border because of the trump administrations actions border crossings are at a still unacceptable year low stop drugs
the fake news washington post has another of many phony headlines defiant as china adds trade wrong should read defiant as us adds trade penalties will end barriers and massive ip typically bad reporting
thanks to our historic tax cuts america is open for business and millions of american workers are seeing more takehome pay through higher wages salaries and

the failing new york times wrote another phony story it was political pundit doug schoen not a ukrainian businessman who asked me to do a short speech by phone skype hosted by doug in ukraine i was very positive about ukraineanother negative to the fake russia c story
so much fake news about what is going on in the white house very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china the coming north korea meeting and of course the vicious gas attack in syria feels great to have bolton larry k on board i we are
doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation which takes tremendous time and focus no collusion or obstruction other than i fight back so now they do the unthinkable and raid a lawyers office for information bad
russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria get ready russia because they will be coming nice and new and you be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it
our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the cold war there is no reason for this russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together stop the arms race
much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake corrupt russia investigation headed up by the all democrat loyalists or people that worked for obama mueller is most conflicted of all except rosenstein who signed fisa comey letter no collusion so they go crazy

so proud of our great military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our country has ever had there be anything or anyone even close
unbelievably james comey states that polls where crooked hillary was leading were a factor in the handling stupidly of the clinton email probe in other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job slimeball
the big questions in badly reviewed book answered like how come he gave up classified information jail why did he lie to congress jail why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi why they take it why the phony memos more
comey throws ag lynch the why we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch was she promised a supreme court seat or ag in order to lay off hillary no golf and grandkids talk give us all a break
the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term it should be brought back use often
i never asked comey for personal loyalty i hardly even knew this guy just another of his many lies his are self serving and fake
attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past i have many too many lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken all lawyers are deflated and concerned

president xi of china and i are working together to give massive chinese phone company zte a way to get back into business fast too many jobs in china lost commerce department has been instructed to get it done
china and the united states are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of china for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries but be cool it will all work out
remember how badly iran was behaving with the iran deal in place they were trying to take over the middle east by whatever means necessary now that will not happen

the washington post and cnn have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with china nothing has happened with zte except as it pertains to the larger trade deal our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with china
we have not seen demands yet which should be few in that previous us administrations have done so poorly in negotiating china has seen our demands there has been no folding as the media would love people to believe the meetings
even started yet the us has very little to give because it has given so much over the years china has much to give

wow word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi on the trump campaign with an embedded andrew mccarthy says probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the if so this is bigger than watergate
despite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted witch hunt we have had the most successful first month administration in us history by far sorry to the fake news media and but the way it is

fake news media had me calling immigrants or illegal immigrants wrong they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories i referred to ms gang members as a big difference and so true fake news got it purposely wrong as usual
why disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the crooked hillary democrats in virginia led by clinton best friend terry m under fbi investigation that they killed gave to wife in her run for office then dropped case on clinton

if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee also senate judiciary is asking for can give the conclusive answers drain the swamp
things are really getting ridiculous the failing and crooked but not as crooked as hillary clinton nytimes has done a long boring story indicating that the most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia me so now they are looking at the rest of the world
at what point does this soon to be witch hunt composed of angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for years stop they have found no collussion with russia no obstruction but they looking at the corruption
in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted emails got while secretary of state paid mccabes wife and got off the fbi hook along with terry m and so much more republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam
now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world they should easily be able to take it into the midterm elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party worry about dems fisa abuse missing emails or fraudulent dossier
what ever happened to the server at the center of so much corruption that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging except in the case of democrats fbi they broke into homes offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the server
and why the podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington dc
the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia so now looking at the rest of the world great
i hereby demand and will do so officially tomorrow that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbidoj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration
i ask senator chuck schumer why president obama the democrats do something about trade with china including theft of intellectual property etc they did nothing with that being said chuck i have long agreed on this issue fair trade plus with china will happen
china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farmagricultural products would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years
on china barriers and tariffs to come down for first time
china must continue to be strong tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in i want this to happen and north korea to be very successful but only after signing
brennan is panicking he has disgraced himself he has disgraced the country he has disgraced the entire intelligence community he is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of faith in the intelligence community and in some people at the
top of the fbi brennan started this entire debacle about president trump we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the phony dossierhe knows about the dossier he denies knowledge of the dossier he briefs the gang of on the hill about the dossier which
they then used to start an investigation about trump it is that simple this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle this was a political hit job this was not an intelligence investigation brennan has disgraced himself worried about staying out of dan bongino
the wall street journal asks in the world was barack a very good question

it was my honor to welcome nascar cup series champion martintruexjr and his team to the whitehouse
for the first time since roe v wade america has a prolife president a prolife vice president a prolife house of representatives and prolife republican state
if the person placed very early into my campaign a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered many times higher than normal
follow the money the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia because there was no collusion he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win just like they did to bernie sanders who got duped
foxandfriends bombshell in the obama spying scandal did other agencies spy on trump even clapper worlds dumbest former intelligence head who has the problem of lying a lot used the word spy when describing the illegal activities
look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state they go after phony collusion with russia a made up scam and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before what goes around comes around
clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump judge andrew napolitano
spygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history
everybody is with tomi lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman foxandfriends
should be happy that the fbi was spying on his no james clapper i am not happy spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot

sadly i was forced to cancel the summit meeting in singapore with kim jong unpictwittercomrlwxxbxfkx
it was my great honor to host a roundtable re yesterday in bethpage new york democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can support law enforcement and save innocent
i have decided to terminate the planned summit in singapore on june while many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially i believe that this is a tremendous setback for north korea and indeed a setback for the
the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing campaign is different than having a spy as illegal as that may be but what about an who is paid a fortune and who way earlier than the russian hoax
can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party in absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain and to think that the party in question even with the expenditure of far more money lost
knows there was a spy and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spywidespread spying involving multiple mollie hemingway the federalist senior editor but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story
democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea just like they are coming to the defense of ms thugs saying that they are individuals must be nurtured or asking to end your big tax cuts raise your taxes instead dems have lost touch
very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea we will soon see where it will lead hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace only time and talent will tell
today it was my great honor to deliver the commencement address at the united states navalacademy in annapolis maryland congratulations good luck godspeed and anchors

chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just let them do their job the killings are at a record pace and tough police work which chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fastthe killings must stop
funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they even know what the deals are and when for years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states lost almost billionyear under
senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees change of management and board must purchase us parts and pay a billion fine dems do nothing
but complain and obstruct they made only bad deals iran and their socalled trade deals are the laughing stock of the world

thanks to very brave teacher hero jason seaman of noblesville indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world
unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to how to deal with north koreaand if there was it matter the nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning
the failing nytimes quotes senior white house who exist as saying if the meeting were reinstated holding it on june would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning wrong again use real people not phony sources
with spies or as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister but not all over my campaign even from a very early date why the crooked highest levels of the fbi or contact me to tell me of the phony russia problem
when will the angry democrats those who worked for president o reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest been a long time now will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems justice fbi russia
welcome home

our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day kim jong un agrees with me on this it will happen
why president obama do something about the socalled russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he want to upset the apple cart he was in charge not me and did nothing
happy memorial day those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for blacks and hispanics ever women in rebuilding our military and so much more nice
president deserves some foxnews in discussing
yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the justice dept i find her actions to be really quite jonathan turley

the heroes who rest in these hallowed fields in cemeteries battlefields and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of american life they came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies from privilege and from

a democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts no chance this is too good to be true for republicansremember the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime the border and want to be gentle and kind to gang membersnot good
california has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime high tax problems along with so many others on june vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox a really good and highly competent man make california great again
democrats mistakenly tweet pictures from term showing children from the border in steel cages they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad but backfires dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of countrybipartisan bill
we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea meetings are currently taking place concerning summit and more kim young chol the vice chairman of north korea heading now to new york solid response to my letter thank you
investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about it just a wiretap against a campaign aideit was secretly gathering information on the trump campaignpeople call that spyingthis is unprecedented and mollie hemingway
the angry democrats plus people who worked years for obama working on the rigged russia witch hunt will be meddling with the midterm elections especially now that republicans stay tough are taking the lead in polls there was no collusion except by the democrats
why the angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton a rigged witch hunt why ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration
sorry got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear bad trade deals va choice the economy rebuilding the military and so much more and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clintonrussiafbijusticeobamacomeylynch etc
the fake mainstream media has from the time i announced i was running for president run the most highly sophisticated dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics no matter how well we do they find fault but the forgotten men women won president
reptrey gowdy think so i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job not afterward if i were the president and i picked someone to be the
chief law enforcement officer and they told me later by the way not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office i would be frustrated tooand how i read that senator sessions why you tell me before i picked you
there are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody and i wish i did
the failing and corrupt nytimes estimated the crowd last night at when in fact it was many times that number and the arena was this is the way they demean and disparage they are very dishonest people who me and never did
bob iger of abc called valerie jarrett to let her know that does not tolerate comments like made by roseanne barr gee he never called president donald j trump to apologize for the horrible statements made and said about me on abc maybe i just get the call
great meeting with kimkardashian today talked about prison reform and
there is no one better to represent the people of ny and staten island a place i know very well than repdandonovan who is strong on borders crime loves our military our vets voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again dan has my full endorsement
very importantly repdandonovan will win for the republicans in novemberand his opponent will not remember alabama we take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democrat
the soon to be released book russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald written by gregg jarrett looks like a real deal big hit the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see out in weeks
recusal of jeff sessions was an unforced betrayal of the president of the united joe digenova former us attorney
rush limbaugh the fbi was so concerned and if they targeting trump they should have told trump if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign hoax then why not try to stop it why not tell trump because they were pushing this
iger where is my call of apology you and abc have offended millions of people and they demand a response how is brian ross doing he tanked the market with an abc lie yet no apology double standard
the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people spies informants into my campaign surveillance much
not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true
very good meetings with north korea
will be giving a full pardon to dinesh today he was treated very unfairly by our government
fair trade
ap has just reported that the russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over million and going up fast no collusion except by the democrats
why they firing no talent samantha bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show a total double standard but ok we are winning and will be doing so for a long time to come
looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at this morning
canada has treated our agricultural business and farmers very poorly for a very long period of time highly restrictive on trade they must open their markets and take down their trade barriers they report a really high surplus on trade with us do timber lumber in us
today it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the united states coast guardpictwittercomraypbogxuz
ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers neil irwin of the nytimes
brennan no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar not only is he a liar a liar about being a dan bongino on foxandfriends
million spent a scam investigation americans are being worked we now know there was russian collusion with russians and the democrats the mueller team is stacked with antitrumpers who actually represented clinton people gave to crooked dan bongino

there was no collusion with russia except by the democrats when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end so bad for our country is the special counseljustice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media should be looking at dems corruption instead
the united states must at long last be treated fairly on trade if we charge a country zero to sell their goods and they charge us or even percent to sell ours it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated that is not free or fair trade it is stupid trade
why is it that the wall street journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the us by other countries or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into us coffers
when almost billion dollars a year down on trade you lose a trade war the us has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade time to get smart
jesse watters only thing trump obstructed was hillary getting to the white so true
as only one of two people left who could become president why the fbi or department of have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort on charges that were years old and had been previously dropped during my campaign should have told me
paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time he represented ronald reagan bob dole many others over the years but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him and he have been hired
mark penn are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff why is there an independent counsel to go after people and their families for unrelated offensesconstitution was set up to prevent thisstormtrooper tactics a disgrace
this is my day in office and we have accomplished a lot many believe more than any president in his first days massive tax regulation cuts military vets lower crime illegal immigration stronger borders judgeships best economy jobs ever and much more
we had repeal replace done and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars except for one person but it is getting done anyway individual mandate is gone and great less expensive plans will be announced this month drug prices coming down right to try
is the best time ever to look for a james freeman of wsj
as has been stated by numerous legal scholars i have the absolute right to pardon myself but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong in the meantime the never ending witch hunt led by very angry and conflicted democrats others continues into the midterms
china already charges a tax of on soybeans canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products not acceptable
the us has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win
farmers have not been doing well for years mexico canada china and others have treated them unfairly by the time i finish trade talks that will change big trade barriers against us farmers and other businesses will finally be broken massive trade deficits no longer
the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional despite that we play the game because i unlike the democrats have done nothing wrong
the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt
in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a job
big supreme court ruling for baker just out
the philadelphia eagles football team was invited to the white house unfortunately only a small number of players decided to come and we canceled the event staying in the locker room for the playing of our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling sorry
what is taking so long with the inspector report on crooked hillary and slippery james comey numerous delays hope report is not being changed and made weaker there are so many horrible things to tell the public has the right to know transparency
the us has an increased economic value of more than trillion dollars since the election may be the best economy in the history of our country record jobs numbers nice

we have had many championship teams recently at the white house including the chicago cubs houston astros pittsburgh penguins new england patriots alabama and clemson national champions and many others national anthem more great music today at pm
the russian witch hunt hoax continues all because jeff sessions tell me he was going to recuse himselfi would have quickly picked someone else so much time and money wasted so many lives ruinedand sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion
meeting in singapore with north korea will hopefully be the start of something bigwe will soon see
nascar and champion martintruexjr were recently at the white house it was a great day for a great sport
separating families at the border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the democrats border security laws should be changed but the dems get their act together started the wall

wow strzokpage the incompetent corrupt fbi lovers have texts referring to a counterintelligence operation into the trump campaign dating way back to december spygate is in full force is the mainstream media interested yet big stuff
great interview by loudobbs with chris farrell of judicial watch concerning the governments counterintelligence operation into the trump campaign spygate at the highest level who would believe
chris farrell judicial watch were running an operation to undermine a candidate for president of the us these are all violations of law this is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system
this is a level of criminality beyond the pale this is such a grave abuse of power and authority like nothing else seen in our history this makes the nixon watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
the greatest witch hunt in political history
mitch mcconnell announced he will cancel the august recess great maybe the democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of high crime and high taxes we need border security
great night for republicans congratulations to john cox on a really big number in california he can win even fake news cnn said the trump impact was really big much bigger than they ever thought possible so much for the big blue wave it may be a big red wave working hard
gold star father ceejay metcalf whose great son michael was just honored at the white house was fantastic this morning on foxandfriends he is a special man
the fake news media has been so unfair and vicious to my wife and our great first lady melania during her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death to facelift to left the wh and me for ny or virginia to abuse all fake she is doing really well
four reporters spotted melania in the white house last week walking merrily along to a meeting they never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world was really ill or whatever fake news is really bad
many more republican voters showed up yesterday than the fake news thought possible the political pundits just get what is going on out there or they do get it but refuse to report the facts remember dems are high tax high crime easy to beat
congratulations to dana rohrabacher on his big california win we are proud of you dana
it ironic getting ready to go to the in canada to fight for our country on trade we have the worst trade deals ever made then off to singapore to meet with north korea the nuclear problembut back home we still have the angry democrats pushing the witch hunt
good luck to alice johnson have a wonderful life
alan dershowitz harvard law professor all proves that we never needed a special counselall of this could have been done by the justice dept need a multimillion dollar group of people with a target on back not the way justice should so true
when and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the angry democrats plus working on the witch hunt hoax there has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted it is all a democrat excuse for losing the election where is the server
how could jeff flake who is setting record low polling numbers in arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own senate seat without even a fight and who have a clue think about running for office even a lower one again face it a flake
looking forward to seeing my friend prime minister abeshinzo of japan at noon will be discussing north korea and trade
our justice department must not let awan debbie wasserman schultz off the hook the democrat it scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today they want to make a to hide what is on their server where is server really bad
when will people start saying you mr president for firing james
the obama administration is now accused of trying to give iran secret access to the financial system of the united states this is totally illegal perhaps we could get the angry democrats to divert some of their energy to this as comey would call it investigate
making america great
my great honor to welcome prime minister abeshinzo back to the
today i am greatly honored to welcome my good friend pm abe of japan to the whitehouse over the past months the prime minister and i have worked closely together to address common challenges of which there are
pm abe and i are also working to improve the trading relationship between the us and japan something we have to do the us seeks a bilateral deal with japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity working hard to reduce our trade
great day of meetings with prime minister abeshinzo of
please tell prime minister trudeau and president macron that they are charging the us massive tariffs and create nonmonetary barriers the eu trade surplus with the us is billion and canada keeps our farmers and others out look forward to seeing them tomorrow
prime minister trudeau is being so indignant bringing up the relationship that the us and canada had over the many years and all sorts of other thingsbut he bring up the fact that they charge us up to on dairy hurting our farmers killing our agriculture
why the european union and canada informing the public that for years they have used massive trade tariffs and nonmonetary trade barriers against the us totally unfair to our farmers workers companies take down your tariffs barriers or we will more than match you
obama schumer and pelosi did nothing about north korea and now weak on crime high tax schumer is telling me what to do at the summit the dems could never set up schumer failed with north korea and iran we need his advice
canada charges the us a tariff on dairy products they tell you that did they not fair to our farmers
looking forward to straightening out unfair trade deals with the countries if it happen we come out even better
congratulations to the washington capitals on their great play and winning the stanley cup championship alex ovechkin the team captain was spectacular a true superstar dc is popping in many ways what a time

just met the new prime minister of italy giuseppeconteit a really great guy he will be honored in washington at the whitehouse shortly he will do a great job the people of italy got it right
just left the summit in beautiful canada great meetings and relationships with the six country leaders especially since they know i cannot allow them to apply large tariffs and strong barriers to
usa trade they fully understand where i am coming from after many decades fair and reciprocal trade will happen
the united states will not allow other countries to impose massive tariffs and trade barriers on its farmers workers and companies while sending their product into our country tax free we have put up with trade abuse for many decades and that is long enough
i am on my way to singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for north korea and the world it will certainly be an exciting day and i know that kim jongun will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before
peace and great prosperity for his land i look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this onetime opportunity will not be wasted
based on false statements at his news conference and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our us farmers workers and companies i have instructed our us reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the us market
pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that tariffs were kind of and he not be pushed very dishonest weak our tariffs are in response to his of on dairy
fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal according to a canada release they make almost billion dollars in trade with us guess they were bragging and got caught minimum is tax dairy from us at then justin acts hurt when called out
why should i as president of the united states allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses as they have for decades while our farmers workers taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay not fair to the people of america billion trade deficit
and add to that the fact that the us pays close to the entire cost of natoprotecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade they pay only a fraction of the costand laugh the european union had a billion surplusshould pay much more for military
germany pays slowly of gdp towards nato while we pay of a much larger gdp does anybody believe that makes sense we protect europe which is good at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on trade change is coming
great to be in singapore excitement in the air
sorry we cannot let our friends or enemies take advantage of us on trade anymore we must put the american worker first
thank you prime minister lee hsien
meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quicklybut in the end that matter we will all know soon whether or not a real deal unlike those of the past can happen

i strongly endorse adam laxalt for governor of nevada adam is smart works hard and knows how to win he will be a great governor also will fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime
mark sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to maga he is mia and nothing but trouble he is better off in argentina i fully endorse katie arrington for congress in sc a state i love she is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes vote katie
heading back home from singapore after a truly amazing visit great progress was made on the denuclearization of north korea hostages are back home will be getting the remains of our great heroes back to their families no missiles shot no research happening sites closing

i want to thank chairman kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people our unprecedented meeting the first between an american president and a leader of north korea proves that real change is
the world has taken a big step back from potential nuclear catastrophe no more rocket launches nuclear testing or research the hostages are back home with their families thank you to chairman kim our day together was historic
a year ago the pundits talking heads people that do the job before were begging for conciliation and peace meet go to now that we meet and have a great relationship with kim jong un the same haters shout out meet do not
my political representatives want me to get involved in the mark sanford primary thinking that sanford would easily win but with a few hours left i felt that katie was such a good candidate and sanford was so bad i had to give it a shot congrats to katie arrington
robert de niro a very low iq individual has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies i watched him last night and truly believe he may be i guess he
realize the economy is the best ever been with employment being at an all time high and many companies pouring back into our country wake up punchy
congratulations to corey stewart for his great victory for senator from virginia now he runs against a total stiff tim kaine who is weak on crime and borders and wants to raise your taxes through the roof underestimate corey a major chance of winning
just landed a long trip but everybody can now feel much safer than the day i took office there is no longer a nuclear threat from north korea meeting with kim jong un was an interesting and very positive experience north korea has great potential for the future
before taking office people were assuming that we were going to war with north korea president obama said that north korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem no longer sleep well tonight
we save a fortune by not doing war games as long as we are negotiating in good faith which both sides are
the us together with mexico and canada just got the world cup congratulations a great deal of hard work
oil prices are too high opec is at it again not good
so funny to watch the fake news especially nbc and cnn they are fighting hard to downplay the deal with north korea days ago they would have for this deallooked like war would break out our biggest enemy is the fake news so easily promulgated by fools
senator claire mccaskill of the great state of missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her rv tour of the state are not for her people are really upset so phony josh hawley should win big and has my full endorsement
congratulations to danny tarkanian on his big gop primary win in nevada danny worked hard an got a great result looking good in november
congratulations to kevincramer on his huge win in north dakota we need kevin in the senate and i strongly endorse him heidi voted no on our tax cuts and always will vote no when we need her kevin is strong on crime borders big on cutting taxes
the republican party is starting to show very big numbers people are starting to see what is being done results are speaking loudly north korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way
now that i am back from singapore where we had a great result with respect to north korea the thought process must sadly go back to the witch hunt always remembering that there was no collusion and no obstruction of the fabricated no crime
so the democrats make up a phony crime collusion with the russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak comey classified information so that a special councel will be appointed and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news
the sleazy new york democrats and their now disgraced and run out of town ag eric schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in and gave out to charity more money than it took in i settle this case
schneiderman who ran the clinton campaign in new york never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case which lingered in their office for almost years now he resigned his office in disgrace and his disciples brought it when we would not settle
happy birthday to the usarmy thank you for your bravery sacrifices and dedication to the usa we love
fbi agent peter strzok who headed the clinton russia investigations texted to his lover lisa page in the ig report that candidate trump from becoming president get any lower than that
the ig report is a total disaster for comey his minions and sadly the fbi comey will now officially go down as the worst leader by far in the history of the fbi i did a great service to the people in firing him good instincts christopher wray will bring it proudly back
thank you for all of the compliments on getting the world cup to come to the usa mexico and canada i worked hard on this along with a great team of talented people we never fail and it will be a great world cup a special thanks to bob kraft for excellent advice
usa jobs numbers are the best in years if my opponent the democrats had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations the economy and jobs would have been a disaster
wow the highest rated by far morning show foxandfriends is on the front lawn of the white house maybe have to take an unannounced trip down to see them
in the world barack obama fire this guy asks mark levin
trump was right to fire james mark levin
the democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall end catch release visa lottery and chain and go to merit based immigration go for it win
wow what a tough sentence for paul manafort who has represented ronald reagan bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns know manafort was the head of the mob what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others very unfair
had to beat very talented people including the bush dynasty then i had to beat the clinton dynasty and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig reportand never forget the fake news media it never ends
i have a great relationship with angela merkel of germany but the fake news media only shows the bad photos implying anger of negotiating an agreement where i am asking for things that no other american president would ask
democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation for a change this is why we need more republicans elected in november democrats are good at only three things high taxes high crime and obstruction sad
my supporters are the smartest strongest most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country as we get stronger so does our country best numbers ever
the ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers peter strzok and lisa page who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history
chuck schumer said summit was what the texans call all cattle and no thank you chuck but are you sure you got that right no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites hostages already back hero remains coming home much more
daniel henninger of the wall street journal ig report makes it clear as did rod memo that trump was absolutely justified unquestionably justified in firing jim comey so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right witch hunt
funny how the fake news in a coordinated effort with each other likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i because all they have to disparage we got so much for peace in the world more is being added in finals even got our hostagesremains
holding back the during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation also quite provocative can start up immediately if talks break down which i hope will not happen
the denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia they are so happy over here in our country some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win even if it does save potentially millions millions of lives
our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been companies doing really well and moving back to america and jobs numbers are the best in years
washington post employees want to go on strike because bezos paying them enough i think a really long strike would be a great idea employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time is wapo a registered lobbyist
witch hunt there was no russian collusion oh i see there was no russian collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax too bad they look at crooked hillary like this double standard
why was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media they are not supposed to be doing that and knowing the enemy of the people fake news they put their own spin on it truth matter to them
why was the sick loser peter strzok working on the totally discredited mueller team of angry conflicted democrats when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer lisa page that trump from becoming president witch hunt
the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security safety wait until after the election because you are going to lose
highest level of bias ever witnessed in any law enforcement trey gowdy on the own peter strzok also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller a really sick deal it
why the democrats give us the votes to fix the worst immigration laws where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including coming into our country illegally
the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition crime in germany is way up big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture
we want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us
children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border it is historic with some countries the most dangerous places in the world not going to happen in the us
change the laws
it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration change the laws
if president obama who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have the fake news would have named him a national hero
comey gave strozk his marching orders mueller is best friend witch hunt
i think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election a rigged witch huntp
crime in germany is up plus officials do not want to report these crimes since migrants were accepted others countries are even worse be smart america
if you have borders you have a country
democrats are the problem they care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our country like they win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters
we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally of the children are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions
i want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the southern borderit has been going on for many many
homeland security secnielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete nasty laws which force family separation we want and security in america
earlier today flotus melania and i were honored to welcome king felipe vi and queen letizia of spain to the
thank you housegoppictwittercomscvacfjwts
the fake news is not mentioning the safety and security of our country when talking about illegal immigration our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the dems will do anything not to change them to obstructwant open borders which means crime
the democrats fault they give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation they want open borders which breeds horrible crime republicans want security but i am working on something it never ends
texts have revealed antitrump foxnews big news but the fake news want to cover total corruption the witch hunt has turned out to be a scam at some point soon the mainstream media will have to cover correctly too big a story
had a great meeting with the house gop last night at the capitol they applauded and laughed loudly when i mentioned my experience with mark sanford i have never been a fan of his
worry the republicans and your president will fix itpictwittercomxsbupzxbhj

hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go will always be disfunctional people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the us illegally children brought back to their country

exfbi layer lisa page today defied a house of representatives issued subpoena to testify before congress wow but is anybody really surprised together with her lover fbi agent peter strzok she worked on the rigged witch hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case ever
how can the rigged witch hunt proceed when it was started influenced and worked on for an extended period of time by former fbi agentlover peter strzok read his hate filled and totally biased emails and the answer is clear
billions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year at my request but it nearly enough us spends too much borders are bad pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptable
as i head out to a very important nato meeting i see that fbi loveragent lisa page is dodging a subpoena is refusing to show up and testify what can she possibly say about her statements and lies so much corruption on the other side where is the attorney general foxnews
presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia they pay only a fraction of their cost the us pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe and loses big on trade
on top of it all germany just started paying russia the country they want protection from billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia not acceptable all nato nations must meet their commitment and that must ultimately go to
a very nice note from chairman kim of north korea great progress being
great success today at nato billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election great spirit

the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia even a confrontation that could lead to war they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that probably have a good relationship with putin we are doing much better than any other country
recognized russian meddling many thank you to foxandfriends and foxnews for actually showing the clips the fake news wants no part of that narrative too bad they want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set
really big jobs meeting today at the white house pm
i told you so the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies google they truly have taken advantage of the us but not for long

recognized russian meddling many
will the dems and fake news ever learn this is
my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri such a tragedy such a great loss may god be with you all
china the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the us is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day taking away our big competitive edge as usual not a level playing field
the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well tightening now hurts all that we have done the us should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals debt coming due we are raising rates really
farmers have been on a downward trend for years the price of soybeans has fallen since years before the election a big reason is bad terrible trade deals with other countries they put on massive tariffs and barriers canada charges on dairy farmers will win
i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin in the old days they would call it diplomacy if i was loud vicious i would have been criticized for being too tough remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim hypocrites
the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again believe it it in contract that players must stand at attention hand on heart the commissioner must now make a stand first time kneeling out for game second time kneeling out for seasonno pay
inconceivable that the government would break into a office early in the morning almost unheard of even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client totally unheard of perhaps illegal the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong
the rigged witch hunt headed by the angry democrats and now more have been added one who worked directly for obama wh seems intent on damaging the republican chances in the november election this democrat excuse for losing the election never ends
no collusion no obstruction but that matter because the angry democrats who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing

congratulations to judicialwatch and tomfitton on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of and fbi misled the courts witch hunt rigged a scam
looking more more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon surveillance for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc ask her how that worked out she did better with crazy bernie republicans must get tough now an illegal scam
andrew mccarthy said this could never happen this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff not just the people who gave it it is so bad it screams out at on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt
i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it so bad for our country
so president obama knew about russia before the election why he do something about it why he tell our campaign because it is all a big hoax why and he thought crooked hillary was going to win
to iranian president rouhani never ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence death be cautious
tom fitton on foxandfriends at am now judicial watch
so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc that was knowingly falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt
was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team this is a clinton campaign document it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump
page a spy an agent of the russians he would have cooperated with the fbi it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target tom fitton judicialwatch a disgrace to america they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now
when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin and all that i gave up remember i gave up nothing we merely talked about future benefits for both countries also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the corrupt media
a rocket has not been launched by north korea in months likewise no nuclear tests japan is happy all of asia is happy but the fake news is saying without ever asking me always anonymous sources that i am angry because it is not going fast enough wrong very happy
the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the us supreme court two months ago next up is the us post office which they use at a fraction of real cost as their for a big percentage of their packages
in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive the paper loses a fortune lobbyist for amazon is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought
countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate this should have taken place many years ago but as the saying goes better late than never
tariffs are the greatest either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with tariffs as simple as that and talking remember we are the being robbed all will be great
our country is doing great best financial numbers on the planet great to have usa winning again
heading to missouri to be with many of my great friends vfw here we come
make america great again
very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the democrats they definitely want trump
the european union is coming to washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on trade i have an idea for them both the us and the eu drop all tariffs barriers and subsidies that would finally be called free market and fair trade hope they do it we are ready but they
so sad and unfair that the fcc approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved much bigger but not sinclair disgraceful
russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton frame donald is a hot seller already number one more importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly congratulations to gregg jarrett
every time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs i wonder what can they be thinking are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off lost billion on trade last year no weakness
when you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation it will only take longer to make a deal and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity negotiations are going really well be cool the end result will be worth it
china is targeting our farmers who they know i love respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the us they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt we were being nice until now china made billion on us last year
what kind of a lawyer would tape a client so sad is this a first never heard of it before why was the tape so abruptly terminated cut while i was presumably saying positive things i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped can this be so too bad
congratulations to brian kemp on your very big win in georgia last night wow those are big numbers now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the democrats have given you she is weak on vets the military and the amendment win
the united states and the european union have a trillion bilateral trade relationship the largest economic relationship in the world we want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all american and european
sergio marchionne who passed away today was one of the most brilliant successful car executives since the days of the legendary henry ford it was a great honor for me to get to know sergio as potus he loved the car industry and fought hard for it he will be truly missed
thank you very much working
great meeting on trade today with junckereu and representatives of the european union we have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs no barriers and no subsidies work on documents has already started and the process is moving
along quickly european union nations will be open to the united states and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them there was great warmth and feeling in the room a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible
obviously the european union as represented by junckereu and the united states as represented by yours truly love each
thank you georgia they say that my endorsement last week of brian kemp in the republican primary for governor against a very worthy opponent lifted him from points down to a to victory two very good and talented men in a great race but congratulations to brian
great to be back on track with the european union this was a big day for free and fair trade
european union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately also they will be buying vast amounts of lng
twitter prominent republicans not good we will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once many complaints
heading to dubuque iowa and then granite city illinois looking forward to being with many great friends
the united states will impose large sanctions on turkey for their long time detainment of pastor andrew brunson a great christian family man and wonderful human being he is suffering greatly this innocent man of faith should be released immediately
promises
alandersh a brilliant lawyer who although a liberal democrat who probably vote for me has discussed the witch hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way he has written a new and very important book
called case against impeaching which i would encourage all people with trump derangement syndrome to read
america is open for business and us steel is
the remains of american servicemen will soon be leaving north korea and heading to the united states after so many years this will be a great moment for so many families thank you to kim jong un
arrived back in washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major us steel plant in granite city illinois only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted robert mueller and his gang of angry democrats obviously cannot find collusion
the only collusion with russia was with the democrats so now they are looking at my tweets along with million other people the rigged witch hunt continues how stupid and unfair to our countryand so the fake news waste my time with dumb questions no
i did not know of the meeting with my son don jr sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam taxi cabs maybe he even retained bill and crooked lawyer gee i wonder if they helped him make the choice
great gdp numbers just released will be having a news conference soon

congressman david kustoff has been a champion for the trump agenda i greatly appreciate his support david is strong on crime and borders loves our military vets and second amendment get out and vote for david on thursday august he has my full and total endorsement
democrats who want open borders and care little about crime are incompetent but they have the fake news media almost totally on their side
the only things the democrats do well is which is their campaign slogan and chuck schumer has almost great american people that are waiting to serve our country a total disgrace mitch m should not let them go home until all approved

tom homan fmr ice director is nobody that has done more for border security public safety than president trump worked for six presidents and i respect them all but nobody has done more than this administration president trump just a stone cold
wow highest poll numbers in the history of the republican party that includes honest abe lincoln and ronald reagan there must be something wrong please recheck that poll
please understand there are consequences when people cross our border illegally whether they have children or not and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes congress must act on fixing the dumbest worst immigration laws anywhere in the world vote
had a very good and interesting meeting at the white house with ag sulzberger publisher of the new york times spent much time talking about the vast amounts of fake news being put out by the media how that fake news has morphed into phrase of the sad
the biggest and best results coming out of the good gdp report was that the quarterly trade deficit has been reduced by billion and of course the historically low unemployment numbers especially for african americans hispanics asians and women
i would be willing to government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security which includes the wall must get rid of lottery catch release etc and finally go to system of immigration based on merit we need great people coming into our country
when the media driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome reveals internal deliberations of our government it truly puts the lives of many not just journalists at risk very unpatriotic freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news
accurately of media coverage of my administration is negative despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low i will not allow our great country to be sold out by antitrump haters in the
dying newspaper industry no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people as an example the failing new york times
and the amazon washington post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements and they will never change
there is no collusion the robert mueller rigged witch hunt headed now by increased from including an obama white house lawyer angry democrats was started by a fraudulent dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc therefore the witch hunt is an illegal scam
is robert mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to president trump including the fact that we had a very nasty contentious business relationship i turned him down to head the fbi one day before appointment as sc comey is his close friend
also why is mueller only appointing angry dems some of whom have worked for crooked hillary others including himself have worked for obamaand why mueller looking at all of the criminal activity real russian collusion on the democrats sidepodesta dossier
we must have border security get rid of chain lottery catch release sanctuary cities go to merit based immigration protect ice and law enforcement and of course keep building but much faster the wall

the globalist koch brothers who have become a total joke in real republican circles are against strong borders and powerful trade i never sought their support because i need their money or bad ideas they love my tax regulation cuts judicial picks more i made
them richer their network is highly overrated i have beaten them at every turn they want to protect their companies outside the us from being taxed for america first the american worker a puppet for no one two nice guys with bad ideas make america great again
rush limbaugh is a great guy who truly gets it
one of the reasons we need great border security is that murder rate in increased by to people killed a record the democrats want open borders i want maximum border security and respect for ice and our great law enforcement professionals foxnews
collusion is not a crime but that matter because there was no collusion except by crooked hillary and the democrats
i am looking into plastic guns being sold to the public already spoke to nra seem to make much sense

border security is national security and national security is the longterm viability of our country a government shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and prosperous america
on my way to tampa florida look forward to seeing everyone
agent peter strzok on the mueller team should have recused himself on day one he was out to stop the election of donald trump he needed an insurance policy those are illegal improper goals trying to influence the election he should never ever been allowed to
remain in the fbi while he himself was being investigated this is a real issue it go into a mueller report because mueller is going to protect these guys mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his alan dershowitz
this is a terrible situation and attorney general jeff sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further bob mueller is totally conflicted and his angry democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to usa
paul manafort worked for ronald reagan bob dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders he worked for me for a very short time why government tell me that he was under investigation these old charges have nothing to do with collusion a hoax
russian collusion with the trump campaign one of the most successful in history is a total hoax the democrats paid for the phony and discredited dossier which was along with comey mccabe strzok and his lover the lovely lisa page used to begin the witch hunt disgraceful
looking back on history who was treated worse alfonse capone legendary mob boss killer and enemy number or paul manafort political operative reagandole darling now serving solitary confinement although convicted of nothing where is the russian collusion
already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is marc thiessen washington post
it was my great honor to be joined by leading pastors and faith leaders from across our nation today at the

tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated china market has dropped in last and they are talking to us our market is stronger than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible trade deals are successfully renegotiated america first
tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our steel industry plants are opening all over the us steelworkers are working again and big dollars are flowing into our treasury other countries use tariffs against but when we use them foolish people scream
tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today only fools would disagree we are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of tariffs we win either way
china which is for the first time doing poorly against us is spending a fortune on ads and pr trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on tariffs because they are really hurting their economy likewise other countries we are winning but must be strong

tariffs are working big time every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the us always to our detriment i say as they cometax them if they want to be taxed let them make or build the product in the us in either event it means jobs and great wealth
because of tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the trillion in debt that has been accumulated much by the obama administration while at the same time reducing taxes for our people at minimum we will make much better trade deals for our country
fake news reporting a complete fabrication that i am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son donald had in trump tower this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics and it went nowhere i did not know about it
why mueller and the angry democrats looking at the meetings concerning the fake dossier and all of the lying that went on in the fbi and doj this is the most one sided witch hunt in the history of our country fortunately the facts are all coming out and fast
too bad a large portion of the media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the rigged witch hunt but that is why we call them fake news
presidential approval numbers are very good strong economy military and just about everything else better numbers than obama at this point by far we are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a blue wave but there might be a red wave
with russia was very real hillary clinton and her team colluded with the russians and so did adam schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was russians to obtain compromising material on djt we also know that hillary clinton paid through
a law firm eventually kremlin connected sources to gather info on donald trump collusion is very real with russia but only with hillary and the democrats and we should demand a full dan bongino on foxandfriends looking forward to the new ig report

guy was corrupt and had antitrump animus strzok and others at the fbi should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation instead mueller is pretending nothing went wrong he used strzok he used the clinton dnc dossierthe whole thing

concerned about firing afraid they will be said bruce ohr emails notes show bruce connection to phony discredited trump dossier a creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act rigged witch hunt
tuckercarlson speaking of john brennan did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be cia director in the first now that is a really good question then followed by blumenthal of connecticut is a fake war so true a total fake
how can richard blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a connecticut politician bragging that he was a great marine war hero in vietnam then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a marine nor ever in vietnam pass judgement on anyone loser
incredibly corrupt fbi doj trying to steer the outcome of a presidential election brennan has gone off the deep end disgraced and discredited himself his conduct has been chris farrell judicial watch
recent statements purport to know as fact that the trump campaign colluded with a foreign power if director statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the cia why he include it in the intelligence community assessment

in speaking with some of the top business leaders i asked what it is that would make business jobs even better in the us quarterly reporting go to a six month said one that would allow greater flexibility save money i have asked the sec to study
how does a politician cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the us survive making the statement not going to make america great again it was never that great which section of the sentence is worse
the local politicians who run washington dc poorly know a windfall when they see it when asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that i cancelled it never let someone hold you up i will instead

wow big pushback on governor andrew cuomo of new york for his really dumb statement about lack of greatness i have already made america great again just look at the markets jobs military setting records and we will do even better andrew badly mistake
when a politician admits that not going to make america great there seem to be much reason to ever vote for him this could be a career threatening statement by andrew cuomo with many wanting him to resignhe will get higher ratings than his brother chris
which is worse hightax andrew cuomos statement not going to make america great again it was never that or hillary statement
i say was a bigger and more incompetent blunder he should easily win his race against a super liberal actress but his political career is over

news has learned that bruce ohr wrote christopher steele following the firing of james comey saying that he was afraid the antitrump russia probe will be charles payne foxbusiness how much more does mueller have to see they have blinders on rigged
ohr of doj is in legal jeopardy astonishing that still employed bruce nelly bank account is getting fatter fatter because of the dossier that they are both peddling he disclose it under fed regs using your federal office for personal
financial gain is a federal gratuity statute violation bribery statute violation honest services violationall major crimesbecause the doj is run by blank jeff gregg jarrett so when does mueller do what must be done probably never foxnews
social media is totally discriminating against republicanconservative voices speaking loudly and clearly for the trump administration we let that happen they are closing down the opinions of many people on the right while at the same time doing nothing to others
censorship is a very dangerous thing absolutely impossible to police if you are weeding out fake news there is nothing so fake as cnn msnbc yet i do not ask that their sick behavior be removed i get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or watch at all
too many voices are being destroyed some good some bad and that cannot be allowed to happen who is making the choices because i can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made let everybody participate good bad and we will all just have to figure it out
all of the fools that are so focused on looking only at russia should start also looking in another direction china but in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone

has anyone looked at the mistakes that john brennan made while serving as cia director he will go down as easily the worst in history since getting out he has become nothing less than a loudmouth partisan political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country
great job rachel camposduffy on foxandfriends

i allowed white house counsel don mcgahn and all other requested members of the white house staff to fully cooperate with the special counsel in addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents most transparent in history no collusion no obstruction witch hunt
the failing nytimes wrote a fake piece today implying that because white house councel don mcgahn was giving hours of testimony to the special councel he must be a john dean type but i allowed him and all others to testify i have to i have nothing to hide
and have demanded transparency so that this rigged and disgusting witch hunt can come to a close so many lives have been ruined over nothing mccarthyism at its worst yet mueller his gang of dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side media is even worse
no collusion and no obstruction except by crooked hillary and the democrats all of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted bob mueller refuses to even look in that direction what about the brennan comey mccabe strzok lies to congress or emails
the failing new york times wrote a story that made it seem like the white house councel had turned on the president when in fact it is just the opposite the two fake reporters knew this this is why the fake news media has become the enemy of the people so bad for america
some members of the media are very angry at the fake story in the new york times they actually called to complain and apologize a big step forward from the day i announced the times has been fake news and with their disgusting new board member it will only get worse
study the late joseph mccarthy because we are now in period with mueller and his gang that make joseph mccarthy look like a baby rigged witch hunt
disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over hours with the white house councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone
looking for trouble they are enjoying ruining lives and refuse to look at the real corruption on the democrat side the lies the firings the deleted emails and soooo much more angry dems are looking to impact the election they are a national disgrace
the collusion they made up a phony crime called collusion and when there was no collusion they say there was obstruction of a phony crime that never existed if you fight back or say anything bad about the rigged witch hunt they scream obstruction
i hope john brennan the worst cia director in our history brings a lawsuit it will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the mueller rigged witch hunt he sue
everybody wants to keep their security clearance worth great prestige and big dollars even board seats and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect brennan it certainly because of the good job he did he is a political
will bruce ohr whose family received big money for helping to create the phony dirty and discredited dossier ever be fired from the jeff sessions department a total joke
ohr is at the center of false allegations which led to a multimillion dollar investigation into what apparently darrell issa house oversight we can take out the word foxnews

i have asked secretary of state mike pompeo not to go to north korea at this time because i feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula
additionally because of our much tougher trading stance with china i do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were despite the un sanctions which are in place
secretary pompeo looks forward to going to north korea in the near future most likely after our trading relationship with china is resolved in the meantime i would like to send my warmest regards and respect to chairman kim i look forward to seeing him soon

statement from the white house president donald j trump feels strongly that north korea is under tremendous pressure from china because of our major trade disputes with the chinese government at the same time we also know that china is providing north korea with
considerable aid including money fuel fertilizer and various other commodities this is not helpful nonetheless the president believes that his relationship with kim jong un is a very good and warm one and there is no reason at this time to be spending large amounts
of money on joint ussouth korea war games besides the president can instantly start the joint exercises again with south korea and japan if he so chooses if he does they will be far bigger than ever before as for the trade disputes and other
differences they will be resolved in time by president trump and great president xi jinping their relationship and bond remain very strong

charge of the fisa court he should direct the presiding judge rosemary collier to hold a hearing haul all of these people from the doj fbi in there if she finds there were crimes committed and there were there should be a criminal referral by greggjarrett
the hatred and extreme bias of me by cnn has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function but actually as i have always said this has been going on for a long time little jeff z has done a terrible job his ratings suck att should fire him to save credibility
going on at cnn is happening to different degrees at other networks with nbcnews being the worst the good news is that andy lacky is about to be fired for incompetence and much worse when lester holt got caught fudging my tape on russia they were hurt badly
i just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the media is truth matter to them they only have their hatred agenda this includes fake books which come out about me all the time always anonymous sources and are pure fiction enemy of the people

the large and violent french protests take into account how badly the united states has been treated on trade by the european union or on fair and reasonable payments for our great military protection both of these topics must be remedied soon

children from parents as did bush etc because that is the policy and law i tried to keep them together but the problem is when you do that vast numbers of additional people storm the border so with obama seperation is fine but with trump not fake minutes

the reason that the small truck business in the us is such a go to favorite is that for many years tariffs of have been put on small trucks coming into our country it is called the if we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here

china has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into china from the us currently the tariff is
my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one relations with china have taken a big leap forward very good things will happen we are dealing from great strength but china likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed level the field
farmers will be a a very big and fast beneficiary of our deal with china they intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately we make the finest and cleanest product in the world and that is what china wants farmers i love you
president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change on trade and far beyond between our two great nations a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all
i am certain that at some time in the future president xi and i together with president putin of russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race the us spent billion dollars this year crazy
we would save billions of dollars if the democrats would give us the votes to build the wall either way people will not be allowed into our country illegally we will close the entire southern border if necessary also stop the drugs

the negotiations with china have already started unless extended they will end days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with president xi in argentina bob lighthizer will be working closely with steve mnuchin larry kudlow wilbur ross and peter navarro
on seeing whether or not a real deal with china is actually possible if it is we will get it done china is supposed to start buying agricultural product and more immediately president xi and i want this deal to happen and it probably will but if not remember
i am a tariff man when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so it will always be the best way to max out our economic power we are right now taking in billions in tariffs make america rich again
but if a fair deal is able to be made with china one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done i will happily sign let the negotiations begin make america great again

in the world i want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving environment but american taxpayers and american workers pay to clean up others pollution
we are either going to have a real deal with china or no deal at all at which point we will be charging major tariffs against chinese product being shipped into the united states ultimately i believe we will be making a deal either now or into the future
china does not want tariffs
officially echoed president donald optimism over bilateral trade talks chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of us soybeans liquified natural gas the first sign confirming the claims of president donald trump and the white house that
china had agreed to start buying us business
very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip including stops from argentina not to sound naive or anything but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting all subjects discussed
one of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with president xi of china is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl coming into the united states it will now be considered a this could be a game changer on what is
considered to be the worst and most dangerous addictive and deadly substance of them all last year over people died from fentanyl if china cracks down on this using the death penalty for distributors and pushers the results will be incredible
looking forward to being with the bush family this is not a funeral this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life he will be missed

on occasions former fbi director james comey told house investigators he know recall or remember things when asked opened investigations on americans not know who signed off and know christopher steele all lies
james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day his friday testimony was so untruthful this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president they are now exposed
the trump administration has accomplished more than any other us administration in its first two not even years of existence we are having a great time doing it all of this despite the fake news media which has gone totally out of its mindtruly the enemy of the people
find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james testimony no smocking gunno foxnews because there was no collusion so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution
which it was not but even if it was it is only a civil case like but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine liability if he made a mistake not me cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced witch hunt
james behind closed doors testimony reveals that was not evidence of campaign with russia when he left the fbi in other words the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started
fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump loudobbs details on tuesday night
despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country people have not been able to get through our newly built walls makeshift walls fences or border patrol officers military they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries
ice border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border a great wall would be however a far easier less expensive solution we have already built large new sections fully renovated others making them like new the democrats
however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do not want border security they want open borders for anyone to come in this brings large scale crime and disease our southern border is now secure and will remain that way
i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer nancy pelosi in democrats voted for a wall and they were right to do so today they no longer want border security they will fight it at all cost and nancy must get votes for speaker but the wall will get built
people do not yet realize how much of the wall including really effective renovation has already been built if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country the military will build the remaining sections of the wall they know how important it is
great job by michael anton on foxandfriends a true national security expert
very productive conversations going on with china watch for some important announcements
fake news has it purposely wrong many over ten are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position why someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington please report news correctly thank you
james comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in in other words he is and has been a democrat comey had no right heading the fbi at any time but especially after his mind exploded
care what you think of the presidentit cannot bleed over to the fbicomey is confirming there is bias in the chris swecker

the democrats and president obama gave iran billion dollars and got nothing but they give billion dollars for national security and a wall
flotus melania will be interviewed by seanhannity tonight on foxnews at
i often stated way or the other mexico is going to pay for the this has never changed our new deal with mexico and canada the usmca is so much better than the old very costly antiusa nafta deal that just by the money we save mexico is paying for the wall
i never directed michael cohen to break the law he was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law it is called of and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made that is why they get paid despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly
stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws if they even apply because this was not campaign finance cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not
guilty even on a civil basis those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he didincluding the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook as a lawyer michael has great liability to me
they gave general flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated the fbi said he lie and they overrode the fbi they want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements sad
witch hunt
if it was a conservative that said what mika brzezinski stated on her show yesterday using a certain horrible term that person would be banned permanently from television
she will probably be given a pass despite their terrible ratings congratulations to richardgrenell our great ambassador to germany for having the courage to take this horrible issue on
just did an interview with harrisfaulkner on foxnews airing now enjoy
today it was my honor to welcome our newly elected governors to the whitehousepictwittercomlcpfiorglp
not do a shutdown democrats do right for the american
china just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them they have just suspended us tariff hikes us is doing very well china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal it could happen and rather soon
many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with north korea i always reply by saying we are in no hurry there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country
kim jong un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people we are doing just fine
i am pleased to announce that mick mulvaney director of the office of management budget will be named acting white house chief of staff replacing general john kelly who has served our country with distinction mick has done an outstanding job while in the administration
i look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to make america great again john will be staying until the end of the year he is a great patriot and i want to personally thank him for his service
for the record there were many people who wanted to be the white house chief of staff mick m will do a great job
as i predicted all along obamacare has been struck down as an unconstitutional disaster now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects preexisting conditions mitch and nancy get it done
wow but not surprisingly obamacare was just ruled unconstitutional by a highly respected judge in texas great news for america
secretary of the interior ryanzinke will be leaving the administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and i want to thank him for his service to our nation
the trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the interior next week
never in the history of our country has the been more dishonest than it is today stories that should be good are bad stories that should be bad are horrible many stories like with the real story on russia clinton the dnc seldom get reported too bad
the pathetic and dishonest weekly standard run by failed prognosticator bill kristol who like many others never had a clue is flat broke and out of business too bad may it rest in peace
wow texts between lisa page and her lover peter s of the fbi in charge of the russia hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news witch hunt
a real scandal is the one sided coverage hour by hour of networks like nbc democrat spin machines like saturday night live it is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and dem commercials should be tested in courts be legal only defame belittle collusion
so where are all the missing text messages between fired fbi agents peter s and the lovely lisa page his lover just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean what an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted witch hunt moves ever so slowly forward want them
remember michael cohen only became a after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started they broke into an office why they break into the dnc to get the server or office
at the request of many i will be reviewing the case of a military major matt golsteyn who is charged with murder he could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a terrorist bomb maker while overseas petehegseth foxnews
judge ken starr former solicitor generel independent counsel just stated that after two years is no evidence or proof of further that is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the thank you judge foxnews
the democrats policy of child seperation on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now remember the picture of children in cages the obama years however if you separate far more people will come smugglers use the kids
required television watching is last weeks marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of rod blagojevich and the trishregan interview with a jerome corsi if that tell you something about what has been going on in our country nothing will very sad
looks here as though general defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to donald trump without quite knowing what that crime might be it stops looking like prosecution and more looking like
a persecution of the daniel henninger the wall street journal thank you people are starting to see and understand what this witch hunt is all about jeff sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total hoax to get started in the first place
the russian witch hunt hoax started as the long before i even got elected is very bad for our country they are entrapping people for misstatements lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago nothing to do with collusion a democrat scam
the deductible which comes with obamacare is so high that it is practically not even useable hurts families badly we have a chance working with the democrats to deliver great healthcare a confirming supreme court decision will lead to great healthcare results for americans
it is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation the outside world blowing up around us paris is burning and china way down the fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike take the victory
anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good border security without a wall write them off as just another politician following the party line time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have at the same time far greater safety and control
today i am making good on my promise to defend our farmers ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations i have authorized secretary perdue to implement the round of market facilitation payments our economy is stronger than stand with our farmers
biggest outrage yet in the long winding and highly conflicted mueller witch hunt is the fact that demanded text messages between peter strzok and his fbi lover lisa page were purposely illegally deleted would have explained whole hoax which is now under protest
good luck today in court to general michael flynn will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about russian collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign there was no collusion
i hope the people over at the fed will read wall street journal editorial before they make yet another mistake also let the market become any more illiquid than it already is stop with the feel the market just go by meaningless numbers good luck
facebook twitter and google are so biased toward the dems it is ridiculous twitter in fact has made it much more difficult for people to join realdonaldtrump they have removed many names greatly slowed the level and speed of increase they have acknowledgeddone nothing
illegal immigration costs the united states more than billion dollars a year how was this allowed to happen
russia dossier reporter now doubts dopey christopher claims you get into the details of the steele dossier the specific allegations we have not seen the evidence to support them good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations
will never be proven and are likely thank you to michael isikoff yahoo for honesty what this means is that the fisa warrants and the whole russian witch hunt is a fraud and a hoax which should be ended immediately also it was paid for by crooked hillary dnc
michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed
congratulations to marthamcsally on her appointment by governor dougducey as the great new senator from arizona i have no doubt she will do a fantastic job
the democrats are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a concrete wall but we are not building a concrete wall we are building artistically designed steel slats so that you can easily see through it
it will be beautiful and at the same time give our country the security that our citizens deserve it will go up fast and save us billions of dollars a month once completed
america is the greatest country in the world and my job is to fight for all citizens even those who have made mistakes congratulations to the senate on the bipartisan passing of a historic criminal justice reform bill
this will keep our communities safer and provide hope and a second chance to those who earn it in addition to everything else billions of dollars will be saved i look forward to signing this into law
in our country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to border security and the military the democrats fight to the death we won on the military which is being completely rebuilt one way or the other we will win on the wall
mexico is paying indirectly for the wall through the new usmca the replacement for nafta far more money coming to the us because of the tremendous dangers at the border including large scale criminal and drug inflow the united states military will build the wall
we have defeated isis in syria my only reason for being there during the trump presidency
the trump foundation has done great work and given away lots of money both mine and others to great charities over the years with me taking no fees rent salaries etc now as usual i am getting slammed by cuomo and the dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by
sleazebag ag eric schneiderman who has since resigned over horrific women abuse when i wanted to close the foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics shady eric was head of new yorkers for clinton and refused to even look at the corrupt clinton foundation
in any event it goes on and on the new ag who is now being replaced by yet another ag who openly campaigned on a get trump agenda does little else but rant rave politic against me will never be treated fairly by these people a total double standard of
after historic victories against isis time to bring our great young people homepictwittercomxonjfzqftp
col jim carafano on ingrahamangle has made the middle east a better place when trump came into office isis was running amuck in the middle east over a million refugees poured into western europe none of that is happening today all due to
gets no credit for what done in the middle ingrahamangle so true thank you laura
proud of the president today to hear that he is declaring victory in senator rand paul agree more with the presidents decision by definition this is the opposite of an obama decision senator mike lee
does the usa want to be the policeman of the middle east getting nothing but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who in almost all cases do not appreciate what we are doing do we want to be there forever time for others to finally fight
russia iran syria many others are not happy about the us leaving despite what the fake news says because now they will have to fight isis and others who they hate without us i am building by far the most powerful military in the world isis hits us they are doomed
the democrats who know steel slats wall are necessary for border security are putting politics over country what they are just beginning to realize is that i will not sign any of their legislation including infrastructure unless it has perfect border security usa wins
with so much talk about the wall people are losing sight of the great job being done on our southern border by border patrol ice and our great military remember the caravans well they get through and none are forming or on their way border is tight fake news silent
when i begrudgingly signed the omnibus bill i was promised the wall and border security by leadership would be done by end of year now it happen we foolishly fight for border security for other countries but not for our beloved usa not good
so hard to believe that lindsey graham would be against saving soldier lives billions of why are we fighting for our enemy syria by staying killing isis for them russia iran other locals time to focus on our country bring our youth back home where they belong
general jim mattis will be retiring with distinction at the end of february after having served my administration as secretary of defense for the past two years during tenure tremendous progress has been made especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting
equipment general mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations a new secretary of defense will be named shortly i greatly thank jim for his service
thank you to our great republican members of congress for your vote to fund border security and the wall the final numbers were and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before so proud of you all now on to the senate
soon to be speaker nancy pelosi said last week live from the oval office that the republicans have the votes for border security today the house republicans voted and won nancy does not have to apologize all i want is great border security
senator mitch mcconnell should fight for the wall and border security as hard as he fought for anything he will need democrat votes but as shown in the house good things happen if enough dems vote it will be a democrat shutdown house republicans were great yesterday
the democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a wall calling it old fashioned the fact is there is nothing that will work and that has been true for thousands of years like the wheel there is nothing better i know tech better than anyone technology
on a border is only effective in conjunction with a wall properly designed and built walls work and the democrats are lying when they say they in israel the wall is successful will not be any different on our southern border hundreds of billions saved
no matter what happens today in the senate republican house members should be very proud of themselves they flew back to washington from all parts of the world in order to vote for border security and the wall not one democrat voted yes and we won big i am very proud of you
the democrats whose votes we need in the senate will probably vote against border security and the wall even though they know it is desperately needed if the dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time people want open borders and crime
house republican vote
shutdown today if democrats do not vote for border security
even president ronald reagan tried for years to build a border wall or fence and was unable to do so others also have tried we will get it done one way or the other
mitch use the nuclear option and get it done our country is counting on you
thank you stevedaines for being willing to go with the socalled nuclear option in order to win on desperately needed border security have my total support
there has never been a president who has been tougher but fair on china or russia never just look at the facts the fake news tries so hard to paint the opposite picture
general anthony tata author i think the president is making the exact right move in syria all the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on isis intelligence and gave rise to
the democrats now own the shutdown
done more damage to isis than all recent presidentsnot even close
a design of our steel slat barrier which is totally effective while at the same time
some of the many bills that i am signing in the oval office right now cancelled my trip on air force one to florida while we wait to see if the democrats will help us to protect southern
wishing supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg a full and speedy recovery
our great country must have border
i am in the white house working hard news reports concerning the shutdown and syria are mostly fake we are negotiating with the democrats on desperately needed border security gangs drugs human trafficking more but it could be a long stay on syria we were originally
going to be there for three months and that was seven years ago we never left when i became president isis was going wild now isis is largely defeated and other local countries including turkey should be able to easily take care of whatever remains coming home
will be having lunch in white house residence with large group concerning border security
the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall let work begin
i won an election said to be one of the greatest of all time based on getting out of endless costly foreign wars also based on strong borders which will keep our country safe we fight for the borders of other countries but we fight for the borders of our own
senate adjourns until december
brett mcgurk who i do not know was appointed by president obama in was supposed to leave in february but he just resigned prior to leaving grandstander the fake news is making such a big deal about this nothing event
if anybody but your favorite president donald j trump announced that after decimating isis in syria we were going to bring our troops back home happy healthy that person would be the most popular hero in america with me hit hard instead by the fake news media crazy
when president obama ingloriously fired jim mattis i gave him a second chance some thought i i thought i should interesting relationshipbut i also gave all of the resources that he never really had allies are very importantbut not when they take advantage of us
the only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or barrier drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works
i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense patrick shanahan will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy previously boeing he will be great
i just had a long and productive call with president rterdogan of turkey we discussed isis our mutual involvement in syria the slow highly coordinated pullout of us troops from the area after many years they are coming home we also discussed heavily expanded trade
unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in indonesia more than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for we are praying for recovery and healing america is with you
we signed two pieces of major legislation this week criminal justice reform and the farm bill these are two big deals but all the fake news media wants to talk about is of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars it all began years ago
senator bob corker just stated that so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years and what i told the people of our state what do serve for two but that is not true wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i endorse him
thanks randpaul am very proud of the president this is exactly what he promised and i think the people agree with him been at war too long and in too many placesspent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere why he got
should not be the job of america to replace regimes around the world this is what president trump recognized in iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and rightthe generals still get the randpaul
mitch mcconnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the us senate for years and the last two have been by far the best most productive of his career tax regulation cuts va choice farm bill criminal justice reform judgeships much more great
the most important way to stop gangs drugs human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border we need border security and as everyone knows you have border security without a wall the drones technology are just bells and whistles safety for america
president has been remarkable i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment and he will be a constant reminder of what populism thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning
president rterdogan of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syriaand he is a man who can do it plus turkey is right our troops are coming home
virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked that they turned against it desperately needed
to those few senators who think i like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong i do what i like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states both in military protection and trade
we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the us and our taxpayers on trade general mattis did not see this as a problem i do and it is being fixed
for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with billion dollars in cash sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal now terminated approved by little bob corker
america is respected again
the only problem our economy has is the fed they have a feel for the market they understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders the fed is like a powerful golfer who score because he has no touch he putt
i never at the acting attorney general of the us a man for whom i have great respect this is a made up story one of many by the fake news media
the wall is different than the billion dollars in border security the complete wall will be built with the shutdown money plus funds already in hand the reporting has been inaccurate on the point the problem is without the wall much of the rest of dollars are wasted
saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria instead of the united states see it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country the us that is miles away thanks to saudi a
i am all alone poor me in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about crazy
christmas eve briefing with my team working on north korea progress being made looking forward to my next summit with chairman
i am in the oval office just gave out a mile long contract for another large section of the wall in texas we are already building and renovating many miles of wall some complete democrats must end shutdown and finish funding billions of dollars lives will be saved
merry christmas
flotus melania and i were honored to visit our incredible troops at al asad air base in iraq god bless the
just returned from visiting our troops in iraq and germany one thing is certain we have incredible people representing our country people that know how to win
have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border need to stop drugs human traffickinggang members criminals from coming into our country do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats
the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their obstruction of great people wanting expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years a us record
the reason the daca for wall deal get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the circuit allowed daca to remain thereby setting up a supreme court case after ruling dems dropped deal and where we are today democrat obstruction of the needed wall
patrol agents want the say they want the wall even though they know it is really needed and they want ice they have much to campaign on do they an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity
there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop time to get tough on border security build the wall
brad blakeman american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them the president says look this is your neighborhood got to stand up to protect yourselves always look to
this about the wall everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly in israel the wall works this is only about the dems not letting donald trump the republicans have a win they may have the senate votes but we have the issue border security
cnn others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat i will sign can you imagine my saying no we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported
we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with hard to believe there was a congress president who would approve
the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta over billion dollars a year not including drug money which would be many times that amount that i would consider closing the southern border a making we build a wall or
close the southern border bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs go back to prenafta before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico either we build finish the wall or we close the border
honduras guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it we will be cutting off all aid to these countries taking advantage of us for years
thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany great things are happening
the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover agent peter s these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax this is a total obstruction of justice all texts demanded
i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security from what i hear they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military
just had a long and very good call with president xi of china deal is moving along very well if made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute big progress being made
any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally they if we had a wall they even try the two
children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol the father of the young girl said it was not their fault he given her water in days border patrol needs the wall and it will all end they are working so hard getting so little credit
for those that naively ask why the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year it is because in the senate we need democrat votes and they will gives us for border security now we have to do it the hard way with a shutdown too bad foxnews
is being called year of the by steve moore coauthor of it was indeed a great year for the american worker with the job market in years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and hispanics and all workers big wage
on russian collusion kimberley strassel the wall street journal the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats

veterans on president handling of border security approval rating on being a strong leader ap poll thank you
president and mrs obama builthas a ten foot wall around their dc mansioncompound i agree totally necessary for their safety and security the us needs the same thing slightly larger version
an all concrete wall was never abandoned as has been reported by the media some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides makes sense to me
if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria which was an isis loaded mess when i became president they would be a national hero isis is mostly gone slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families while at the same time fighting isis remnants
i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places now when i start getting out the fake news media or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived like to complain about me my tactics which are working just doing what i said i was going to do
except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be i campaigned against the never ending wars remember
i campaigned on border security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall our southern border has long been an where drugs criminals including human traffickers and illegals would pour into our country dems should get back here an fix now
i am the only person in america who could say that bringing our great troops back home with and get bad press it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining if i stayed in endless wars forever they would still be unhappy
in the oval office democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security including the wall you voted yes in and one more yes but with me in office get it built and fast
incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall work it does and properly built almost they say old technology but so is the wheel they now say it is immoral but it is far more immoral for people to be dying
heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from
senator schumer more than a year longer than any other administration in history these are people who have been approved by committees and all others yet schumer continues to hold them back from serving their country very unfair
happy new
mexico is paying for the wall through the many billions of dollars a year that the usa is saving through the new trade deal the usmca that will replace the horrendous nafta trade deal which has so badly hurt our country mexico canada will also thrive good for all
the democrats will probably submit a bill being cute as always which gives everything away but gives nothing to border security namely the wall you see without the wall there can be no border security the tech is just by comparison meaningless bells whistles
remember this throughout the ages some things never get better and never change you have walls and you have wheels it was always that way and it will always be that way please explain to the democrats that there can never be a replacement for a good old fashioned wall
dr sebastian gorka a very good and talented guy has a great new book just out we lots of insight enjoy

the democrats much as i suspected have allocated no money for a new wall so imaginative the problem is without a wall there can be no real border security and our country must finally have a strong and secure southern border
one thing has now been proven the democrats do not care about open borders and all of the crime and drugs that open borders bring

for far too long senate democrats have been obstructing more than nominations these great americans left their jobs to serve our country but because dems are blocking them some for two yearshistoric record passed committees but schumer putting them on hold bad
here we go with mitt romney but so fast question will be is he a flake i hope not would much prefer that mitt focus on border security and so many other things where he can be helpful i won big and he he should be happy for all republicans be a team player win
mexico is paying for the wall through the new usmca trade deal much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built we have done a lot of work billion dollars that house has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of national security quick payback
important meeting today on border security with republican and democrat leaders in congress both parties must work together to pass a funding bill that protects this nation and its people this is the first and most important duty of government
i remain ready and willing to work with democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders supports the agents and officers on the ground and keeps america safe get it done
sadly there can be no real border security without the wall
the shutdown is only because of the presidential election the democrats know they win based on all of the achievements of so they are going all out on the desperately needed wall and border security and presidential harassment for them strictly politics
the united states treasury has taken in many billions of dollars from the tariffs we are charging china and other countries that have not treated us fairly in the meantime we are doing well in various trade negotiations currently going on at some point this had to be done

as i have stated many times if the democrats take over the house or senate there will be disruption to the financial markets we won the senate they won the house things will settle down they only want to impeach me because they know they win in too much success

great support coming from all sides for border security including wall on our very dangerous southern border teams negotiating this weekend washington post and nbc reporting of events including fake sources has been very inaccurate to put it mildly
the democrats could solve the shutdown problem in a very short period of time all they have to do is approve real border security including a wall something which everyone other than drug dealers human traffickers and criminals want very badly this would be so easy to do
many people currently a part of my opposition including president obama the dems have had campaign violations in some cases for very large sums of money these are civil cases they paid a fine settled while no big deal i did not commit a campaign violation
i care that most of the workers not getting paid are democrats i want to stop the shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on strong border security i am in the white house ready to go where are the dems
we are working hard at the border but we need a wall in million pounds of narcotics seized adults arrested with criminal records and gang members including apprehended a big human trafficking problem

with all of the success that our country is having including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts the fake news totally dishonest media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the truth
the fake news will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the trump administration and me look as bad as possible they use nonexistent sources write stories that are total fiction our country is doing so well yet this is a sad day in america
the fake news media in our country is the real opposition party it is truly the enemy of the people we must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting
congressman adam smith the new chairman of the house armed services committee just stated there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency been done a number of no doubt but get our deal done in congress
the failing new york times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on syria no different from my original statements we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight isis and doing all else that is prudent and necessary

the mainstream media has never been more dishonest than it is now nbc and msnbc are going crazy they report stories purposely the exact opposite of the facts they are truly the opposition party working with the dems may even be worse than fake news cnn if that is possible
gave an off the record luncheon somewhat of a white house tradition or custom to network anchors yesterday and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers
cryin chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that i the table walked out of the room he had a temper because i knew he would say that and after nancy said no to proper border security i politely said byebye and left no slamming
there is great unity with the republicans in the house and senate despite the fake news media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise the opposition party the dems know we must have strong border security but want to give another one of many wins

who is being totally protected by his best friend bob mueller the angry democrats leaking machines who have no interest in going after the real collusion and much more by crooked hillary clinton her campaign and the democratic national committee just watch
i have been far tougher on russia than obama bush or clinton maybe tougher than any other president at the same time as i have often said getting along with russia is a good thing not a bad thing i fully expect that someday we will have good relations with russia again

vietnam is thriving like few places on earth north korea would be the same and very quickly if it would denuclearize the potential is awesome a great opportunity like almost none other in history for my friend kim jong un we will know fairly soon very interesting
the democrats should stop talking about what i should do with north korea and ask themselves instead why they do during eight years of the obama administration
i have now spent more time in vietnam than da nang dick blumenthal the third rate senator from connecticut how is connecticut doing his war stories of his heroism in vietnam were a total fraud he was never even there we talked about it today with vietnamese leaders

wow just revealed that michael cohen wrote a letter to manuscript for a new book that he was pushing written and submitted long after charlottesville and helsinki his phony reasons for going rogue book is exact opposite of his fake testimony which now is a lie
congress must demand the transcript of michael new book given to publishers a short time ago your heads will spin when you see the lies misrepresentations and contradictions against his thursday testimony like a different person he is totally discredited
i see now that the year russian collusion case has fallen apart there was no collusion except bye crooked hillary and the democrats they say i have an idea look at finances and every deal he has ever done follow discredited michael cohen
and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on wednesday no way time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought witch hunt time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed republicans have been abused long enough must end now
michael book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before he must have forgotten about his book when he testified what does hillary lawyer lanny davis say about this one is he being paid by crooked hillary using her lawyer
i never like being misinterpreted but especially when it comes to otto warmbier and his great family remember i got otto out along with three others the previous administration did nothing and he was taken on their watch of course i hold north korea responsible
for mistreatment and death most important otto warmbier will not have died in vain otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength which will last for many years into the future i love otto and think of him often

virtually everything failed lawyer michael cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me a total new love letter to and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction
the brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer michael cohen shows his testimony was a total lie pundits should only use it
got nasa again great activity and success congrats to spacex and all
said was a total lie but fake media show it i am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad conflicted corrupt people in a witch hunt that is illegal should never have been allowed to start and only because i won the election despite this great success
after more than two years of presidential harassment the only things that have been proven is that democrats and other broke the law the hostile cohen testimony given by a liar to reduce his prison time proved no collusion his just written book manuscript showed what he
how acting now and how we act when in the majority what the democrats are doing is an abuse of power they find anythingthey took a fake dossier find any collusion now they have a fake witness in congressman mark green rtn
my wonderful daughter ivanka will be interviewed tonight by steve hilton on next foxnews pm she works so hard and has achieved so much for the usaand gets so little credit then watch mark levin at pm a great show
the reason i do not want military drills with south korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the us for which we are not reimbursed that was my position long before i became president also reducing tensions with north korea at this time is a good thing
presidential harassment by democrats at the highest level in the history of our country likewise the most vicious and corrupt mainstream media that any president has ever had to endure yet the most successful first two years for any
president we are winning big the envy of the world but just think what it could be
for the democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar fraudster at the same time as the very important nuclear summit with north korea is perhaps a new low in american politics and may have contributed to the never done when a president is overseas shame
to the great people of alabama and surrounding areas please be careful and safe tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming to the families and friends of the victims and to the injured god bless you all
fema has been told directly by me to give the a plus treatment to the great state of alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the tornadoes governorkayivey one of the best in our country has been so informed she is working closely with fema and me
the military drills or war games as i call them were never even discussed in my mtg w kim jong un of news i made that decision long ago because it costs the us far too much money to have those especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost
that the dems are going to try switch from collusion to some other reason it makes them continue to look like sore losers who accept the will of the people in the last election they will do anything to get rid of the arifleischer it will never work

democrats will have a unanimous vote on a issue in opposing republican senators tomorrow the dems are for open borders and crime
republican senators are overthinking vote on national emergency it is very simply border securityno crime should not be thought of any other way we have a major national emergency at our border and the people of our country know it very well

standard former fbi lawyer lisa page admits being told to go easy on very unfair foxnews
lisa page fbi transcript also confirms earlier reporting that page testified russian collusion was still unproven when special counsel robert mueller was catherine herridge foxnews in other words they appointed someone when there was and is no crime bad

a big national emergency vote today by the united states senate on border security the wall which is already under major construction i am prepared to veto if necessary the southern border is a national security and humanitarian nightmare but it can be easily fixed

the movement encourages jewish people to leave the democrat party total disrespect republicans are waiting with open arms remember jerusalem us embassy and the horrible iran nuclear deal oann foxandfriends
evidence that the obama era team of the fbi doj cia were working together to spy on and take out president trump all the way back in a transcript of peter testimony is devastating hopefully the mueller report will be covering this oann foxandfriends
so if there was knowingly acknowledged to be crime when the special counsel was appointed and if the appointment was made based on the fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and now disgraced andrew mccabe he all stated no crime then the special counsel
should never have been appointed and there should be no mueller report this was an illegal conflicted investigation in search of a crime russian collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the democrats for losing an election that they thought they were going to win
this should never happen to a president again
like to thank all of the great republican senators who bravely voted for strong border security and the wall this will help stop crime human trafficking and drugs entering our country watch when you get back to your state they will love you more than ever before

campaigning for the popular vote is much easier different than campaigning for the electoral college like training for the yard dash vs a marathon the brilliance of the electoral college is that you must go to many states to win with the popular vote you go to
just the large states the cities would end up running the country smaller states the entire midwest would end up losing all power we let that happen i used to like the idea of the popular vote but now realize the electoral college is far better for the usa
the democrats are getting very they now want to change the voting age to abolish the electoral college and increase significantly the number of supreme court justices actually got to win it at the ballot box

the mainstream media is under fire and being scorned all over the world as being corrupt and fake for two years they pushed the russian collusion delusion when they always knew there was no collusion they truly are the enemy of the people and the real opposition party
seeing on capitol hill right now is that the democrats are walking back any charges of collusion against the byronyork billhemmer should never have been started a disgrace

the republican party will become the party of great healthcare obamacare is a disaster far too expensive and deductibility ridiculously high virtually unusable moving forward in courts and legislatively
we have a national emergency at our southern border the dems refuse to do what they know is necessary amend our immigration laws would immediately solve the problem mexico with the strongest immigration laws in the world refuses to help with illegal immigration drugs
on this vietnam war veterans day we celebrate the brave vietnam veterans and all of veterans thank you for your service to our great nation
this has been an incredible couple of weeks for
the democrats have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world mexico has the strongest they make more than billion a year on the us therefore congress must change our weak immigration laws now mexico must stop illegals from entering the us
through their country and our southern border mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the us far greater than border costs if mexico immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states throug our southern border i will be closing
the border or large sections of the border next week this would be so easy for mexico to do but they just take our money and besides we lose so much money with them especially when you add in drug trafficking etc that the border closing would be a good thing
had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the gdp stock market would have both been much higher world markets would be in a better place
robert mueller was a hero to the radical left democrats until he ruled that there was no collusion with russia so ridiculous to even say after more than two years since the statement was made by a dirty cop i got the answers i wanted the truth
the problem is no matter what the radical left democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough just watch they will harass complain resist the theme of their movement so maybe we should just take our victory and say no got a country to run
so funny that the new york times the washington post got a pulitzer prize for their coverage negative and fake of collusion with russia and there was no collusion so they were either duped or corrupt in any event their prizes should be taken away by the committee
it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws in less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved but the dems care about the crime they want any victory for trump and the republicans even if good for usa
mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the usa our detention areas are maxed out we will take no more illegals next step is to close the border this will also help us with stopping the drug flow from mexico
trump administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to iran for its sinister behavior at no cost to the us or our allies the definition of a foreignpolicy bret stephens nytimes we are getting stronger all over the world watch
everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the no collusion no obstruction trump campaign began we need to know for future generations to understand this hoax should never be allowed to happen to another president or administration again
the adam schiff problem people abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that prove to be true you look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival who made james freeman wsj
the democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system mexico is likewise doing nothing a very bad combination for our country homeland security is being sooo very nice but not for long
now that the long awaited mueller report conclusions have been released most democrats and others have gone back to the prewitch hunt phase of their lives before collusion delusion took over others are pretending that their former hero bob mueller no longer exists
democrats working with republicans in congress can fix the asylum and other loopholes quickly we have a major national emergency at our border get it done now
can you believe that the radical left democrats want to do our new and very important census report without the all important citizenship question report would be meaningless and a waste of the billions ridiculous that it costs to put together

no matter what information is given to the crazed democrats from the no collusion mueller report it will never be good enough behind closed doors the dems are laughing
democrats should stop fighting sen david disaster relief bill they are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural america
everybody agrees that obamacare work premiums deductibles are far too high really bad healthcare even the dems want to replace it but with medicare for all which would cause million americans to lose their beloved private health insurance the republicans
are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums cost deductibles than obamacare in other words it will be far less expensive much more usable than obamacare vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate win
back the house it will be truly great healthcare that will work for america also republicans will always support preexisting conditions the republican party will be known as the party of great healtcare meantime the usa is doing better than ever is respected again
the democrats today killed a bill that would have provided great relief to farmers and yet more money to puerto rico despite the fact that puerto rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any in history the people of puerto rico
are great but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt puerto rico got far more money than texas florida combined yet their government do anything right the place is a mess nothing works fema the military worked emergency miracles but politicians like
the crazed and incompetent mayor of san juan have done such a poor job of bringing the island back to health billion dollars to puerto rico and now the dems want to give them more taking dollars away from our farmers and so many others disgraceful
puerto rico got billion dollars for the hurricane more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before all their local politicians do is complain ask for more money the pols are grossly incompetent spend the money foolishly or corruptly only take from usa
the best thing that ever happened to puerto rico is president donald j trump so many wonderful people but with such bad island leadership and with so much money wasted cannot continue to hurt our farmers and states with these massive payments and so little appreciation
in repjerry nadler strongly opposed the release of the starr report on bill clinton no information whatsoever would or could be legally released but with the no collusion mueller report which the dems hate he wants it all nothing will ever satisfy them foxandfriends
robert mueller was a godlike figure to the democrats until he ruled no collusion in the long awaited mueller report now the dems even acknowledge his name have become totally unhinged and would like to go through the whole process again it happen
there is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy jerry nadler or shifty adam schiff it is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great country
after many years decades mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their southern border mostly from guatemala honduras and el salvador they have all been taking us money for years and doing absolutely nothing for us just like the democrats in congress
pictwittercomjviodstnnh
seen any democrats down here at the border working with us or asking to speak to any of us they have an open invitation we are getting overrun our facilities are overcapacity we are at an emergency art del cueto national border patrol council
today it was my great honor to welcome nato secretary general jensstoltenberg to the
i was never planning a vote prior to the election on the wonderful healthcare package that some very talented people are now developing for me the republican party it will be on full display during the election as a much better less expensive alternative to obamacare
this will be a great campaign issue i never asked mitch mcconnell for a vote before the election as has been incorrectly reported as usual in the nytimes but only after the election when we take back the house etc republicans will always support preexisting conditions
congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the border if no action border or large sections of border will close this is a national emergency
the republican party is the party of the american dream
despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the fed the economy is looking very strong the china and usmca deals are moving along nicely there is little or no inflation and usa optimism is very high
according to polling few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive they should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started so illegal
there is nothing we can ever give to the democrats that will make them happy this is the highest level of presidential harassment in the history of our country
the new york times had no legitimate sources which would be totally illegal concerning the mueller report in fact they probably had no sources at all they are a fake news paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me
welcome back
thank you
i am pleased to announce that jovita carranza will be nominated as the new sbagov administrator she will be replacing linda mcmahon who has done an outstanding job jovita was a great treasurer of the united states and i look forward to her joining my cabinet
the mueller report democrats lost on collusion now inventing a wsjopinion james freeman loudobbs
the crazed and dishonest washington post again purposely got it wrong mexico for the first time in decades is meaningfully apprehending illegals at their southern border before the long march up to the us this is great and the way it should be the big flow will stop
however if for any reason mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the us will be forced to tariff at all cars made in mexico and shipped over the border to us if that work which it will i will close the border
this will supersede usmca likewise i am looking at an economic penalty for the billion dollars in illegal drugs that are shipped and smuggled through mexico and across our southern border over americans die each year sooo many families destroyed
heading to the southern border to show a section of the new wall being built leaving now
congratulations to brian hagedorn on his big surprise win over a well funded liberal democrat in the great state of wisconsin for a very important supreme court seat republicans are producing big for wisconsin

thank you dhsgov cbp and icegovpictwittercombznwkoujlg
lowest average jobs number for any president since economy doing great if the democrats win it is all varneyco foxandfriends i agree
was a hoax from day dbongino foxandfriends
i have not read the mueller report yet even though i have every right to do so only know the conclusions and on the big one no collusion likewise recommendations made to our great ag who found no obstruction angry trump hating dems later brought to given two
years and million and they found no collusion no obstruction but the democrats no matter what we give them will never be satisfied a total waste of time as frankluntz has just stated america has had enough what have you accomplished public is fed
so get this straight there was no collusion and in fact the phony dossier was a con job that was paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc so the angry democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up fraud i just fought back
against something i knew never existed collusion with russia so ridiculous no obstruction this russia hoax must never happen to another president and law enforcement must find out how did it start
why should i be defending a fraudulent russian witch hunt about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the american people start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts how and why did this terrible event begin never forget
we have redeployed agents at the southern specific ports of entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the united states this will cause traffic commercial delays until such time as mexico is able to use
powerful common sense immigration laws to stop illegals from coming through mexico into the us and removing them back to their country of origin until mexico cleans up this ridiculous massive migration we will be focusing on border security not ports of entry
in the meantime the democrats in congress must help the republicans we need their votes to end the horrible costly and foolish loopholes in our immigration laws once that happens all will be smooth we can never allow open borders
looks like bob team of trump haters angry democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the fake news media make up their own stories with or without sources sources no longer matter to our corrupt dishonest mainstream media they are a joke
pleased to report that the american tourist and tour guide that were abducted in uganda have been released god bless them and their families
secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen will be leaving her position and i would like to thank her for her service
i am pleased to announce that kevin mcaleenan the current us customs and border protection commissioner will become acting secretary for dhsgov i have confidence that kevin will do a great job
more apprehensions captures at the southern border than in many years border patrol amazing country is full system has been broken for many years democrats in congress must agree to fix loopholes no open borders crimes drugs will close southern border if necessary
mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the united states or we will have no other choice than to close the border andor institute tariffs our country is full
reason the whole process seems so politicized is that democrats made up this complete lie about collusion and none of it charles hurt the russian hoax never happened it was a fraud on the american people
nadler is not entitled to this information he is doing this to get it to the democrat katiepavlich
uganda must find the kidnappers of the american tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there bring them to justice openly and quickly
the democrats will never be satisfied no matter what they get how much they get or how many pages they get it will never end but the way life goes
congratulations to virginia great game
the world trade organization finds that the european union subsidies to airbus has adversely impacted the united states which will now put tariffs on billion of eu products the eu has taken advantage of the us on trade for many years it will soon stop
congressman jerry nadler fought me for years on a very large development i built on the west side of manhattan he wanted a rail yard built underneath the development or even better to stop the job he get either the development became very successful nevertheless
i got along very well with jerry during the zoning and building process then i changed course slightly became president and now i am dealing with congressman nadler again some things never end but hopefully it will all go well for everyone only time will tell
the mainstream media has never been more inaccurate or corrupt than it is today it only seems to get worse so much fake news

underlying issue remains the same without a single american being indicted for collusion with russia that is a stunning end considering we were led to believe fake news that something much more dramatic would happen why did people fall for tuckercarlson molly h
the democrats must end the loopholes on immigration so easy to solve
everybody is now acknowledging that right from the time i announced my run for president i was correct on the border remember the heat i took democrats should now get rid of the loopholes the border is being fixed mexico will not let people through
trump flags being waived at the bibi netanyahu victory celebration last
so it has now been determined by people that truly hate president trump that there was no collusion with russia in fact it was an illegal investigation that should never have been allowed to start i fought back hard against this phony treasonous hoax
thank you texas i love
congratulations to erictrump and laraleatrump on the great news so proud
i think what the democrats are doing with the border is treasonous their open border mindset is putting our country at risk will not let this happen
too bad that the european union is being so tough on the united kingdom and brexit the eu is likewise a brutal trading partner with the united states which will change sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you
spy games time for
biggest scandal of our time the coup that failed
beautiful afternoon in the oval office today with a few great american
house democrats want to negotiate a trillion spending increase but even pass their own plan we afford it anyway and not happening
the radical dems reeling in disarray as the president continues to win win and win again the left is pretending to be shocked by ag william testimony before congress in which he said spying did occur on the trump loudobbs foxnews
jobless claims at year low
need to know any more done absolutely done he mueller tried the case no lindseygrahamsc foxandfriends no matter what we do or give to the radical left it will never be enough
president top white house lawyer gregory b craig was indicted yesterday on very serious charges this is a really big story but the fake news new york times even put it on page one rather page washingtonpost not much better page one corrupt news
like the results of the mueller report so now trying everything repdougcollins they should stop wasting time and money and get back to real legislating especially on the border
even the democrats now say that our southern border is a crisis and a national emergency hopefully we will not be getting any more bad outrageous court decisions
due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws we are indeed as reported giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only
the radical left always seems to have an open borders open arms policy so this should make them very happy
we will never forgetpictwittercomvxrgfrfejm
if the radical left democrats all of a sudden want the illegal migrants in their sanctuary cities no more open arms why should others be expected to take them into their communities go home and come into our country legally and through a system of merit
another fake story on nbcnews that i offered pardons to homeland securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities of course this is not true mainstream media is corrupt and getting worse if that is possible every day
in new york state democrats blocked a bill expanding college tuition for gold star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants no wonder so many people are leaving ny very sad
i agree with kim jong un of north korea that our personal relationship remains very good perhaps the term excellent would be even more accurate and that a third summit would be good in that we fully understand where we each stand north korea has tremendous potential for
extraordinary growth economic success and riches under the leadership of chairman kim i look forward to the day which could be soon when nuclear weapons and sanctions can be removed and then watching north korea become one of the most successful nations of the world
why should radical left democrats in congress have a right to retry and examine the two years in the making no collusion mueller report when the crime committed was by crooked hillary the dnc and dirty cops attorney general barr will make the decision
great playing by tigerwoods at the themasters tomorrow will be a big and exciting day for golf and for sports many fantastic players in the hunt ratings gold good luck to all
the new york times sanctuary citiesimmigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact they never call to check for truth their sources often even exist a fraud they will lie cheat anyway possible to make me look bad in years they will be gone
when i won the election in the nytimes had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the election and me so badly they have a clue it was pathetic they even apologized to me but now they are even worse really corrupt reporting
i never offered pardons to homeland security officials never ordered anyone to close our southern border although i have the absolute right to do so and may if mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our border and am not it is all fake corrupt news
so interesting to see the mayor of oakland and other sanctuary cities not want our currently after release due to the ridiculous court ordered day rule if they want to serve our nation by taking care of them why should other cities towns
democrats must change the immigration laws fast if not sanctuary cities must immediately act to take care of the illegal immigrants and this includes gang members drug dealers human traffickers and criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds change the laws now
just out the usa has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to sanctuary cities we hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the state of california which is well known or its poor management high taxes
if the fed had done its job properly which it has not the stock market would have been up to additional points and gdp would have been well over instead of almost no inflation quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite
great masters going on right now tigerwoods is leading with holes left to play very exciting tune in
watching final hole of themasters tigerwoods is looking great

congress should come back to dc now and fix the immigration laws

the radical left democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them they will always resist and obstruct
i finally agree with
mark morgan president border patrol chief gave the following message to me trump stay the i agree and believe it or not we are making great progress with a system that has been broken for many years
those illegal immigrants who can no longer be legally held congress must fix the laws and loopholes will be subject to homeland security given to sanctuary cities and states
the mueller report which was written by angry democrats who also happen to be trump haters and clinton supporters should have focused on the people who spied on my campaign and others who fabricated the whole russia hoax that is never forget the crime
since there was no collusion why was there an investigation in the first place answer dirty cops dems and crooked hillary

attorney general william press conference today at am et watch on foxnews oann
no collusion no

as i have been saying all along no collusion no
trump was being framed he fought back that is not jessebwatters i had the right to end the whole witch hunt if i wanted i could have fired everyone including mueller if i wanted i chose not to i had the right to use executive privilege i
anything the russians did concerning the election was done while obama was president he was told about it and did nothing most importantly the vote was not affected
when there is not an underlying crime with regard to collusion in fact the whole thing was a made up fraud it is difficult to say that someone is obstructing something there was no underlying marthamaccallum foxnews
dozens of federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with a crime and found they it would mean there any evidence you did it and what happened here what we just learned from the mueller tuckercarlson
mueller report is perhaps the single most humiliating thing that has ever happened to the white house press in the history of this country they know they liedmany reporters lied about russia collusion and so much more clapper brennan all tuckercarlson
statements are made about me by certain people in the crazy mueller report in itself written by angry democrat trump haters which are fabricated totally untrue watch out for people that take socalled when the notes never existed until needed because i never
agreed to testify it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the about me some of which are total bullshit only given to make the other person look good or me to look bad this was an illegally started hoax that never should have happened a
big fat waste of time energy and money to be exact it is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes perhaps even spying or treason this should never happen again
wishing a happy passover to all those celebrating in america israel and around the
despite the fact that the mueller report should not have been authorized in the first place was written as nastily as possible by angry democrats who were true trump haters including highly conflicted bob mueller himself the end result is no collusion no obstruction
the fake news media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the mueller report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was no collusion with russia the russia hoax is dead
the end result of the greatest witch hunt in us political history is no collusion with russia and no obstruction pretty amazing

the trump haters and angry democrats who wrote the mueller report were devastated by the no collusion finding nothing but a total which should never have been allowed to start in the first place

it amazing that the people who were closest to me by far and knew the campaign better than anyone were never even called to testify before mueller the reason is that the angry democrats knew they would all say and only very good things

the mueller report despite being written by angry democrats and trump haters and with unlimited money behind it lay a glove on me i did nothing wrong if the partisan dems ever tried to impeach i would first head to the us supreme court not only
are there no crimes and there are no crimes by me at all all of the crimes were committed by crooked hillary the dems the dnc and dirty cops and we caught them in the act we waited for mueller and won so now the dems look to congress as last hope
can anyone comprehend what a great job border patrol and law enforcement is doing on our southern border so far this year they have apprehended plus illegal immigrants way up from last year mexico is doing very little for us dems in congress must act now
no collusion no obstruction there has never been a president who has been more transparent millions of pages of documents were given to the mueller angry dems plus i allowed everyone to testify including wh counsel i have to do this but now they want more
congress has no time to legislate they only want to continue the witch hunt which i have already won they should start looking at the criminals who are already very well known to all this was a rigged system we will drain the swamp

despite the fact that the mueller report was by trump haters and angry democrats who had unlimited funds and human resources the end result was no collusion no obstruction amazing

china is adding great stimulus to its economy while at the same time keeping interest rates low our federal reserve has incessantly lifted interest rates even though inflation is very low and instituted a very big dose of quantitative tightening we have the potential to go

ok so after two years of hard work and each party trying their best to make the other party look as bad as possible time to get back to business the mueller report strongly stated that there was no collusion with russia of course and in fact they were rebuffed
at every turn in attempts to gain access but now republicans and democrats must come together for the good of the american people no more costly time consuming investigations lets do immigration border infrastructure much lower drug prices much more and do it now

of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no
after spending more than over a two year period interviewing people using trump hating angry democrats fbi agents all culminating in a more than page report showing no collusion why would the democrats in congress now need robert mueller
to testify are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong no collusion conclusion there was no crime except on the other side incredibly not covered in the report and no obstruction bob mueller should not testify no redos for the dems
report sounded an awful lot as being comeyesque in other words not going to charge this person there even close to being a crime but going to criticize him on the way out the door unfortunate because stepping outside of the robert ray
is not congressional oversight this is jason riley the wall street journal

texas congressman al green says impeachment is the only thing that can prevent president trump from reelection in oann in other words dems win the election fairly you impeach a president for creating the best economy in our history
also there are high crimes no collusion no conspiracy no obstruction all the crimes are on the other side and what the dems should be looking at but they nevertheless the tables are turning
the united states has been losing for many years to billion dollars a year on trade with china we lose billion dollars sorry not going to be doing that anymore

real estate developers in the more than years ago were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would if one was actively building show losses and tax losses in almost all cases much was non monetary sometimes considered
you would get it by building or even buying you always wanted to show losses for tax purposesalmost all real estate developers did and often renegotiate with banks it was sport additionally the very old information put out is a highly inaccurate fake news hit job
the reason for the china pullback attempted renegotiation of the trade deal is the sincere hope that they will be able to with joe biden or one of the very weak democrats and thereby continue to ripoff the united states billion a year for years to come
guess what not going to happen china has just informed us that they vicepremier are now coming to the us to make a deal see but i am very happy with over billion a year in tariffs filling us coffersgreat for us not good for china

we have lost billion dollars a year for many years on crazy trade with china no more
vp mike pence will be interviewed on foxandfriends at am enjoy
talks with china continue in a very congenial manner there is absolutely no need to rush as tariffs are now being paid to the united states by china of on billion dollars worth of goods products these massive payments go directly to the treasury of the us
the process has begun to place additional tariffs at on the remaining billion dollars the us only sells china approximately billion dollars of goods products a very big imbalance with the over billion dollars in tariffs that we take in we will buy
agricultural products from our great farmers in larger amounts than china ever did and ship it to poor starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance in the meantime we will continue to negotiate with china in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal
tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind also much easier quicker to do our farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source
tariffs will make our country much stronger not weaker just sit back and watch in the meantime china should not renegotiate deals with the us at the last minute this is not the obama administration or the administration of sleepy joe who let china get away with
the average balance has soared since the bottom of the market wow
if we bought billion dollars of agriculture from our farmers far more than china buys now we would have more than billion dollars left over for new infrastructure healthcare or anything else china would greatly slow down and we would automatically speed up
build your products in the united states and there are no tariffs
your all time favorite president got tired of waiting for china to help out and start buying from our farmers the greatest anywhere in the world
great consumer price index just out really good very low inflation we have a great chance to good numbers all around
looks to me like going to be sleepycreepy joe over crazy bernie everyone else is fading fast
have been engaged in an unfair relationship with china for a long time they have reneged on the commitments they made to the wto particularly around intellectual carly fiorina mariabartiromo
great republican vote today on disaster relief bill we will now work out a bipartisan solution that gets relief for our great states and farmers thank you to all get me a bill that i can quickly sign
over the course of the past two days the united states and china have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries the relationship between president xi and myself remains a very strong one and conversations
into the future will continue in the meantime the united states has imposed tariffs on china which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations
such an easy way to avoid tariffs make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa very simple
i won the election partially based on no tax returns while i am under audit which i still am and the voters care now the radical left democrats want to again relitigate this matter make it a part of the election
so now the radical left dems talk about collusion anymore because the mueller report said there was no collusion they only want to talk about obstruction even though there was no obstruction or no crime except for the crimes committed by the other side
i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election to see if they could get lucky have a democrat win in which case they would continue to ripoff the usa for billion a year
the only problem is that they know i am going to win best economy employment numbers in us history much more and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term would be wise for them to act now but love collecting big tariffs
i was not going to fire bob mueller and did not fire bob mueller in fact he was allowed to finish his report with unprecedented help from the trump administration actually lawyer don mcgahn had a much better chance of being fired than mueller never a big fan
democrats have nothing just want to distract from this president the fbi was not doing its job the state department was covering things up everyday for hillary at the end of the day fearful of what they did and should be fearful this is a tough
president who is willing to have the battle and we have a great attorney general who is willing to lead the battle and they are going to get to the bottom of edrollins loudobbs
think of it i became president of the united states in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation from long before i ever took office i was under a sick unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the russian
hoax my campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the democrats this never happened before in american history and it all turned out to be a total scam a witch hunt that yielded no collusion no obstruction this must never be allowed to happen again

big attacks on republicans and conservatives by social media not good

we are right where we want to be with china remember they broke the deal with us tried to renegotiate we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china buyers of product can make it themselves in the usa ideal or buy it from nontariffed countries
the democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a they and their partner the fake news media are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible they are a sad joke we may have the strongest economy in our history best
employment numbers ever low taxes regulations a rebuilt military va many great new judges so much more but we have had a giant scam perpetrated upon our nation a witch hunt a treasonous hoax that is the constitutional crisis hopefully guilty people will pay
despite two years and millions of dollars spent the democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the mueller report were made public but they knew there was nothing even before the report was started it is all a big hoax the biggest in american history
ever since the mueller report showed no collusion no obstruction the dems have been working overtime to damage me and the republican party by issuing over demands for documents and testimonies and with no reason all they want to do care about anything else
when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia of course it was supposed to be over back to work for the people but the dems have gone and it has actually gotten worse hope the republicans win back the house in or little will get done
the is the democrats refusing to work let them start by fixing the mess that their immigration laws have caused at the southern border
china is dreaming that sleepy joe biden or any of the others gets elected in they love ripping off america
director james clapper admits that the fbi actions against the trump presidential campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying perhaps fbi director christopher wray will be the next to do loudobbs
another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the democrats that began during the obama administration continued through the mueller fbi operation now the baton has been passed to jerry nadler to continue to abuse power to harass president trump
and the democrat national committeethe democrat party apparatushas been caught using donor dollars to collude with russian intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent me the fbi has no leadership the director is protecting the same gangthat tried to
overthrow the president through an illegal recommended by previous doj tomfitton judicialwatch
the attack strategy of harass this is not about the attorney general who is very sophisticated knows it about him about trying to destroy president trump through an assault on his ag for upholding the rule of law he released a massive amount of
information as long as president trump is president his opposition will use every tool and misuse every tool available to make his life tomfitton judicialwatch loudobbs sadly this proves i am doing a great job also best economy and employment numbers ever
i say openly to president xi all of my many friends in china that china will be hurt very badly if you make a deal because companies will be forced to leave china for other countries too expensive to buy in china you had a great deal almost completed you backed out
thank you foxandfriends great show this morning and congratulations on your number one by far rating well deserved
also congratulations to oann on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump you president
the unexpectedly good first quarter gdp was greatly helped by tariffs from china some people just get it

bernie sanders economy is doing well and sure i have to give trump any credit sure take all the credit that he wrong bernie the economy is doing great and would have crashed if my opponent and yours crooked hillary clinton had ever won
democrat rep tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the holocaust she obviously has tremendous hatred of israel and the jewish people can you imagine what would happen if i ever said what she said and says
there is no reason for the us consumer to pay the tariffs which take effect on china today this has been proven recently when only points were paid by the us points by china because china subsidizes product to such a large degree also the tariffs can be
completely avoided if you buy from a nontariffed country or you buy the product inside the usa the best idea zero tariffs many tariffed companies will be leaving china for vietnam and other such countries in asia why china wants to make a deal so badly
there will be nobody left in china to do business with very bad for china very good for usa but china has taken so advantage of the us for so many years that they are way ahead our presidents did not do the job therefore china should not retaliatewill only get worse
my administration will be fighting for million for the army corps everglades restoration work this year congress needs to help us complete the largest intergovernmental watershed restoration project asap good for florida and good for the environment

in one year tariffs have rebuilt our steel industry it is booming we placed a tariff on steel from china other countries and we now have a big and growing industry we had to save steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong
china buys much less from us than we buy from them by almost billion dollars so we are in a fantastic position make your product at home in the usa and there is no tariff you can also buy from a nontariffed country instead of china many companies are leaving china
so that they will be more competitive for usa buyers we are now a much bigger economy than china and have substantially increased in size since the great election we are the that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of no more
we can make a deal with china tomorrow before their companies start leaving so as not to lose usa business but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal no way we are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made will be taking in
billions of dollars and moving jobs back to the usa where they belong other countries are already negotiating with us because they want this to happen to them they must be a part of usa action this should have been done by our leaders many years ago enjoy
when the time is right we will make a deal with china my respect and friendship with president xi is unlimited but as i have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the united states or it just make any sense we have to be allowed to make up some
of the tremendous ground we have lost to china on trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the wto it will all happen and much faster than people think
our great patriot farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now hopefully china will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product the best but if not your country will be making up the difference based on a very high china buy
this money will come from the massive tariffs being paid to the united states for allowing china and others to do business with us the farmers have been for many years their time is now
china will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing if the federal reserve ever did a it would be game over we win in any event china wants a deal

the mainstream media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today fake news is actually the biggest story of all and is the true enemy of the people why they refuse to cover the real russia hoax but the american people are wise to what is going on
now the new big story is that trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash he need banks but where did he get all of that cash could it be russia no i built a great business and need banks but if i did they would be thereand deutschebank
was very good and highly professional to deal with and if for any reason i like them i would have gone elsewherethere was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from they would be very happy to take my money fake news
have a booming economy and working people are making gains that they seen in stuart varney foxandfriends
why are the democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by crooked hillary and the phony russia investigation they would get back their credibility jerry nadler schiff would have a whole new future open to them perhaps they could even run for president
looks like bernie sanders is history sleepy joe biden is pulling ahead and think about it only here because of sleepy joe and the man who took him off the trash heap president o china wants sleepy joe badly
on this cuban independence day we stand by the people of cuba in their quest for freedom democracy and prosperity the cuban regime must end its repression of cubans venezuelans the united states will not stand idly by as cuba continues to subvert democracy in the americas
the fake news put out a typically false statement without any knowledge that the united states was trying to set up a negotiation with iran this is a false report
iran will call us if and when they are ever ready in the meantime their economy continues to collapse very sad for the iranian people
landing shortly in montoursville pennsylvania see everyone

megan king who is running for superior court judge in the pennsylvania election has my full and total endorsement she is tough on crime and fully understands all aspects of the law vote for megan tomorrow tuesday
just returned to the beautiful whitehouse after a great evening in
i am very disappointed that mexico is doing virtually nothing to stop illegal immigrants from coming to our southern border where everyone knows that because of the democrats our immigration laws are totally flawed broken
attitude is that people from other countries including mexico should have the right to flow into the us that us taxpayers should be responsible for the tremendous costs associated wthis illegal migration mexico is wrong and i will soon be giving a response
pennsylvania forget to get out and vote today for republican fred keller for congress fred is strong on crime second amendment military vets and healthcare he has my complete and total endorsement
so even though i have to do it with presidential privilege i allowed everyone to testify including white house counsel don mcgahn for over hours to robert mueller and the angry trumphating democrats and they arrived
at a conclusion of no collusion and no obstruction the dems were unhappy with the outcome of the mueller report so now they want a doover
shahira knight has done a wonderful job as my legislative affairs director at the white house she was outstanding for us and for our country will be a tremendous success in the private sector
after spending million dollars reviewing million pages of documents interviewing people with the total support of the white house the mueller report was a big disappointment to the democrats so they want a do over it work that wayso bad for our country
the democrats are on a fishing expedition wanting to interview the same people and see the same things as we just went through for two years with robert mueller and the angry dems never happened to a president before never even happened to president obama
john brennan on the mueller probe know if i received bad information but i think i suspected that there was more than there actually wow he admits he was wrong congress should go back to work on drug prices etc
great news for republicans fred keller has just won the hard fought for pennsylvania congressional contest in a landslide over of the vote thanks to the thousands who showed up for the rally last night congratulations to fred and his wonderful family
congratulations to governor mattbevin on winning the republican primary for governor tonight in the great state of kentucky matt you are doing a fantastic job
everything the democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them especially when the mueller report came back with a no collusion finding now they say impeach president trump even though he did nothin wrong while they
after two years of an expensive and comprehensive witch hunt the democrats like the result and they want a do over in other words the witch hunt continues
the democrats are getting zero work done in congress all they are focused on is trying to prove the mueller report wrong the witch hunt
presidential harassment
without the illegal witch hunt my poll numbers especially because of our historically economy would be at too bad the greatest hoax in american history
much of the wall being built at the southern border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new wall and footings problem is the haters say that is not a new wall but rather a renovation wrong and we must build where most needed
also tremendous work is being done on pure renovation fixing existing walls that are in bad condition and ineffective and bringing them to a very high standard
everybody including me thought that when the million dollar mueller report was released with no collusion and no obstruction of a crime caused by others that was the end but no the democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in bad for the country
democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases they ought to start governing you know for a michael goodwin newyorkpost
jerry nadler wants a show he wants to use mr mcgahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that mr trump tried to obstruct the mueller investigation yet mr mueller obstructed in any way his copious report was released for all to see there was no collusion
between russia and the trump campaign mr mcgahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in mr pseudoimpeachment wall street journal editorial board today may
as i have long been saying and has now been proven out this is a witch hunt against the republican party and myself and it was the other side that caused the problem not us
so sad that nancy pelosi and chuck schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our country they can continue the witch hunt which has already cost and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in america or get back to work
but they really want a doover you investigate and legislate simultaneously it just work that way you go down two tracks at the same time let chuck nancy jerry adam and all of the rest finish playing their games
in the meantime my administration is achieving things that have never been done before including unleashing perhaps the greatest economy in our history
democrat leadership is tearing the united states apart but i will continue to set records for the american people and nancy thank you so much for your prayers i know you truly mean it
in a letter to her house colleagues nancy pelosi said trump had a temper tantrum for us all to this is not true i was purposely very polite and calm much as i was minutes later with the press in the rose garden can be easily proven it is all such a lie
zero is getting done with the democrats in charge of the house all they want to do is put the mueller report behind them and start all over again no doovers
democrats want to fix the loopholes at the border they want to do anything open borders and crime
the democrats are getting nothing done in congress all of their effort is about a redo of the mueller report which turn out the way they wanted it is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time their heart is not into infrastructure lower
drug prices preexisting conditions and our great vets all they are geared up to do six committees is squander time day after day trying to find anything which will be bad for me a pure fishing expedition like this never happened before it should never happen again
the democrats have become known as the do nothing party
rex tillerson a man who is as a and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be secretary of state made up a story he got fired that i was outprepared by vladimir putin at a meeting in hamburg germany i think putin would agree look how the us is doing
i was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with pelosi and schumer knowing that they would say i was raging which they always do along with their partner the fake news media well so many stories about the meeting use the rage narrative anyway fake corrupt press
when the democrats in congress refinish for the time their fake work on their very disappointing mueller report finding they will have the time to get the real work of the people done move quickly

foxnews poll a majority of americans want the democrats to stop investigating president trump the mueller report said very strongly no collusion which led to no obstruction the dems get over or the conclusive mueller findings they are now the do nothing party
at the request and recommendation of the attorney general of the united states president donald j trump directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the attorney investigation into surveillance activities
during the presidential election the attorney general has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation in accordance with the longestablished standards for handling classified information
action will help ensure that all americans learn the truth about the events that occurred and the actions that were taken during the last presidential election and will restore confidence in our public presssec

us in order to avoid paying the tariff like mexican companies will move back to the united states once the tariff reaches the higher levels they took many of our companies jobs the foolish pols let it happen and now they will come back unless mexico stops the
travesty that is taking place in allowing millions of people to easily meander through their country and invade the us not to mention the drugs human trafficking pouring in through mexico are the drug lords cartels coyotes really running mexico we will soon find out
when you are the nation that foreign countries have been robbing and deceiving for years the word tariff is a beautiful word indeed others must treat the united states fairly and with respect we are no longer the of the past
the democrats are doing nothing on the border to address the humanitarian and national security crisis could be fixed so easily if they would vote with republicans to fix the loopholes
people have been saying for years that we should talk to mexico the problem is that mexico is an of the united states taking but never giving it has been this way for decades either they stop the invasion of our country by drug dealers cartels human traffickers
coyotes and illegal immigrants which they can do very easily or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move south of the border will be brought back into the united states through taxation tariffs america has had enough
the wall is under construction and moving along quickly despite all of the radical liberal democrat lawsuits what are they thinking as our country is invaded by so many people illegals and things drugs that we do not want make america great again

house democrats fresh off a republican victory against them in federal court on the wall keep asking people to come and testify regarding the no collusion witch hunt they are very unhappy with the mueller report especially with his corrective letter now want a do over
if the totally corrupt media was less corrupt i would be up by points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy maybe best ever if the corrupt media was actually fair i would be up by points nevertheless despite the fake news doing great

nervous nancy pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement especially since i was with foreign leaders overseas there is no evidence for such a thing to have been said nervous nancy dems are getting zero work done in congress
and have no intention of doing anything other than going on a fishing expedition to see if they can find anything on me both illegal unprecedented in us history there was no collusion investigate the investigators go to work on drug price reductions infrastructure
if we are able to make the deal with mexico there is a good chance that we will they will begin purchasing farm agricultural products at very high levels starting immediately if we are unable to make the deal mexico will begin paying tariffs at the level on monday
democrats are incapable of doing a good and solid immigration bill
for all of the money we are spending nasa should not be talking about going to the moon we did that years ago they should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing including mars of which the moon is a part defense and science
heading back to dc many great things are happening for our country
dow jones has best week of the year
i am pleased to inform you that the united states of america has reached a signed agreement with mexico the tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the us on monday against mexico are hereby indefinitely suspended mexico in turn has agreed to take strong measures to
stem the tide of migration through mexico and to our southern border this is being done to greatly reduce or eliminate illegal immigration coming from mexico and into the united states details of the agreement will be released shortly by the state department thank you
while the reviews and reporting on our border immigration agreement with mexico have been very good there has nevertheless been much false reporting surprise by the fake and corrupt news media such as comcastnbc cnn nytimes washingtonpost these are bad news
brandon judd national border patrol council going to be a huge deal because mexico will be using their strong immigration laws a game changer people no longer will be released into the also mexican troops at their southern border currently there are few
mexico will try very hard and if they do that this will be a very successful agreement for both the united states and mexico
mexico has agreed to immediately begin buying large quantities of agricultural product from our great patriot farmers
nervous nancy pelosi the democrat house are getting nothing done perhaps they could lead the way with the usmca the spectacular very popular new trade deal that replaces nafta the worst trade deal in the history of the usa great for our farmers manufacturers unions
everyone very excited about the new deal with mexico
i would like to thank the president of mexico andres manuel lopez obrador and his foreign minister marcelo ebrard together with all of the many representatives of both the united states and mexico for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed
watched msnbc this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week such lies almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth fake news no wonder their ratings along with cnn are way down the hatred comcast has is amazing
just watched the great basketball hall of famer on the marklevinshow foxnews a wonderful interview of a very smart and interesting guy by the man mark levin who has the number one bestselling book unfreedom of the press two winners
little donnydeutsch whose show like his previous shoebiz tries is a disaster has been saying that i had been a friend of his this is false he separately erinburnett used to beg me to be on episodes of the apprentice both were bad but that was it hardly knew him
other than to know he was and is a total loser when he makes statements about me they are made up he knows nothing
i know it is not at all to hit back at the corrupt media or people who work for the corrupt media when they make false statements about me or the trump administration problem is if you hit back people believe the fake news is true so hit back
another false report in the failing nytimes we have been trying to get some of these border actions for a long time as have other administrations but were not able to get them or get them in full until our signed agreement with mexico additionally and for many years
mexico was not being cooperative on the border in things we had or have and now i have full confidence especially after speaking to their president yesterday that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done importantly some things
not mentioned in yesterday press release one in particular were agreed upon that will be announced at the appropriate time there is now going to be great cooperation between mexico the usa something that exist for decades however if for some unknown reason
there is not we can always go back to our previous very profitable position of tariffs but i believe that will be necessary the failing nytimes ratings challenged cnn will do anything possible to see our country fail they are truly the enemy of the people
twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform without restriction called freedom of speech remember you are making a giant mistake
if president obama made the deals that i have made both at the border and for the economy the corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible a national holiday would be immediately declared with me despite our record setting economy and all that i have done no credit
for two years all the democrats talked about was the mueller report because they knew that it was loaded up with angry democrat trump haters later increased to but despite the bias when the report came out the findings were no collusion and facts that led to
no obstruction the dems were devastated after all this time and money spent the mueller report was a disaster for them but they want a redo or do over they are even bringing in cnn sleazebag attorney john dean sorry no do overs go back to work
the failing nytimes story on mexico and illegal immigration through our southern border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue bad reporting and the paper is embarrassed by it the only problem is that they knew it was fake news before it went out corrupt media
now with our new deal mexico is doing more for the usa on illegal immigration than the democrats in fact the democrats are doing nothing they want open borders which means illigal immigration drugs and crime
we have fully signed and documented another very important part of the immigration and security deal with mexico one that the us has been asking about getting for many years it will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by legislative body
we do not anticipate a problem with the vote but if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming tariffs will be reinstated
when will the failing new york times admit that their front page story on the the new mexico deal at the border is a fraud and nothing more than a badly reported on me something that has been going on since the first day i announced for the presidency sick journalism


thank you marklevinshow and john eastmanpictwittercompsoyevynjt
believe they are bringing in john dean the disgraced nixon white house counsel who is a paid cnn contributor no collusion no obstruction democrats just want a doover which never get
i have been briefed on the helicopter crash in new york city phenomenal job by our great first responders who are currently on the scene thank you for all you do the trump administration stands ready should you need anything at all
congratulations to the indianapolis winner ims simonpagenaud and teampenske
despite the phony witch hunt we will continue to make america great again thank


new book just out real deal my decade fighting battles and winning wars with is really wonderful it is written by two people who are very smart know me well george sorial damian bates as opposed to all the books where the author has no clue who i am enjoy
trump bashing show is a headline new york post foxandfriends the greatest witch hunt of all time continues all crimes were by the other side but the committee refuses to even take a look deleting emails is the real obstruction and much more
has spoken he found no collusion between the trump campaign and the russians the bottom line is what the democrat house is doing is trying to destroy the trump presidency which has been a tremendous success and i can assure you that done with the mueller
investigation in the senate they can talk to john dean until the cows come home not doing anything in the senate regarding the mueller report we are going to harden our infrastructure against lindseygrahamsc
presidential harassment
sad when you think about it but mexico right now is doing more for the united states at the border than the democrats in congress foxandfriends
the united states has very low inflation a beautiful thing
maria dagan steve stuart v when you are the big that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producers and most importantly a powerful way to get
companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and pass but very happy with the deal i made
if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of tariff so far little effect to consumer companies will relocate to us
good day in the stock market people have no idea the tremendous potential our country has for growth and many other things
did the democrats run if they want to do senrickscott
on my way to iowa just heard nearly agriculture groups signed a letter urging congress to approve the usmca our patriot farmers rural america have spoken now congress must do its job support these great men and women by passing the bipartisan usmca trade agreement

the fake corrupt news media said they had a leak into polling done by my campaign which by the way and despite the phony and never ending witch hunt are the best numbers we have ever had they reported fake numbers that they made up even exist we will win again

the fake news has never been more dishonest than it is today thank goodness we can fight back on social media their new weapon of choice is fake polling sometimes referred to as suppression polls they suppress the numbers had it in but this is worse
the fake corrupt news media said they had a leak into polling done by my campaign which by the way and despite the phony and never ending witch hunt are the best numbers we have ever had they reported fake numbers that they made up even exist we will win again

unrelated to russia russia russia although the radical left use the name russia anymore since the issuance of the mueller report house committee now plays the seldom used card on our great ag sec of commerce this time on the census dems play a
much tougher game than the republicans did when they had the house majority republicans will remember has already been argued before the us supreme court but the house want to wait this is a common thread between all of the committees do whatever you
can to embarrass the trump administration and republicans attack the trump administration this is campaigning by the attorney david bruno so true in the meantime they are getting no work done on drug pricing infrastructure many other things
cannot impeach president trump did nothing wrong because if they did they would be putting themselves above the law the constitution provides criteria for impeachment treason bribery high crimes misdemeanors unless there is compelling evidence impeachment
is not constitutionally alan dershowitz constitutional lawyer
the dems fight us at every turn in the meantime they are accomplishing nothing for the people they have gone absolutely or unhinged as they like to say
i meet and talk to every day i just met with the queen of england uk the prince of wales the pm of the united kingdom the pm of ireland the president of france and the president of poland we talked about should i immediately
call the fbi about these calls and meetings how ridiculous i would never be trusted again with that being said my full answer is rarely played by the fake news media they purposely leave out the part that matters
when senator markwarnerva spoke at length and in great detail about extremely negative information on me with a talented entertainer purporting to be a russian operative did he immediately call the fbi no in fact he even tell the senate intelligence committee of
which he is a member when repadamschiff took calls from another person also very successfully purporting to be a russian operative did he call the fbi or even think to call the fbi no the fact is that the phony witch hunt is a giant scam where democrats
and other really bad people spied on my campaign they even had an just in case crooked hillary clinton and the democrats lost their race for the presidency this is the biggest worst political scandal in the history of the united states of america sad
been wrong all
while i very much appreciate pm abe going to iran to meet with ayatollah ali khamenei i personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal they are not ready and neither are we

the corrupt news media is totally out of control they have given up and even care anymore mainstream media has zero credibility total losers
i enjoyed my interview with gstephanopoulos on abc so funny to watch the fake news media try to dissect distort every word in as negative a way as possible it will be aired on sunday night at pm and is called trump which is somewhat
misleading in that i personally spent only a small fraction of that time doing interviews i do have a few other things to do you know think i will do many more network interviews as i did in in order to get the word out that no president has done what i have in
the first years of his presidency including the fact that we have one of the best economies in the history of our country it is called earned media in any event enjoy the show
do you believe that the failing new york times just did a story stating that the united states is substantially increasing cyber attacks on russia this is a virtual act of treason by a once great paper so desperate for a story any story even if bad for our country
also not true anything goes with our corrupt news media today they will do or say whatever it takes with not even the slightest thought of consequence these are true cowards and without doubt the enemy of the people
florida governor ron desantis just signed bill banning sanctuary cities in state forcing all law enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities bill prohibits local from enacting sanctuary policies that protect undocumented immigrants foxnews

yesterday was the radical left democrats big impeachment day they worked so hard to make it something really big and special but had one problem almost nobody showed up media admits low turnout for antitrump foxnews around the country people are
saying enough democrat voters want to hear the politicians talking about issues this is a huge distraction and will only help donald trump get jedediahbila president since ronald said a counterprotester lehighvalleylive
a poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper the failing new york times or the amazon lobbyist washington post they are both a disgrace to our country the enemy of the people but i just seem to figure out which is worse the good
news is that at the end of years after america has been made great again and i leave the beautiful white house do you think the people would demand that i stay longer keep america great both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business be forever gone
happy day to all including my worst and most vicious critics of which there are fewer and fewer this is a fantastic time to be an american keep america great

when will the fake news media start asking democrats if they are ok with the hiring of christopher steele a foreign agent paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc to dig up and write a phony dossier against the presidential candidate of the opposing party
if republicans ever did that to the democrats there would be all hell to pay it would be a scandal like no other
almost in new poll say impeach so ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side they win the election fairly
rep alexandria ocasiocortez think we have a very real risk of losing the presidency to donald i agree and that is the only reason they play the impeach card which cannot be legally used

thousands of people are already lined up in orlando some two days before tomorrow nights big rally large screens and food trucks will be there for those that get into the capacity arena it will be a very exciting evening make america great again
the story in the nytimes about the us escalating attacks on power grid is fake news and the failing new york times knows it they should immediately release their sources which if they exist at all which i doubt are phony times must be held fully accountable
wow the state department said it has identified security incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of crooked hillary emails foxnews this is really big never admitted before highly classified material will the dems investigate this

mario draghi just announced more stimulus could come which immediately dropped the euro against the dollar making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the usa they have been getting away with this for years along with china and others

the dems are very unhappy with the mueller report so after almost years they want a redo or do over this is extreme presidential harassment they gave crooked people complete immunity yet now they bring back hope hicks why the dems looking at the
emails that hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed after getting a subpoena from congress that is real obstruction that the dems want no part of because their hearings are rigged and a disgrace to our country
if i have the phony witch hunt going on for years and if the fake news media and their partner in crime the democrats would have played it straight i would be way up in the polls right now with our economy winning by points but winning anyway
so sad that the democrats are putting wonderful hope hicks through hell for years now after total exoneration by robert mueller the mueller report they were unhappy with result so they want a do over very unfair costly to her will it ever end why they
asking hillary clinton why she deleted and acid washed her emails after getting a subpoena from congress anybody else would be in jail for that yet the dems refuse to even bring it up rigged house committee

iran made a very big mistake
it was my great honor to host canadian prime minister justintrudeau at the whitehouse
just revealed that the failing and desperate new york times was feeding false stories about me those associated with me to the fbi this shows the kind of unprecedented hatred i have been putting up with for years with this crooked newspaper is what they have done legal
russia collusion hoax was perpetrated in part by people inside the government and in part by a compliant fake news mollie hemingway tuckercarlson foxandfriends the facts are starting to pour out stay tuned
president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran gave them billion dollars plus billion dollars in cash iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out gave them a free path to nuclear weapons and soon instead of saying thank you iran yelled
death to america i terminated deal which was not even ratified by congress and imposed strong sanctions they are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my presidency when they were causing major problems throughout the middle east now they are bust
on monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in international waters we were cocked loaded to retaliate last night on different sights when i asked how many will die people sir was the answer from a general minutes before the strike i stopped it not
proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone i am in no hurry our military is rebuilt new and ready to go by far the best in the world sanctions are biting more added last night iran can never have nuclear weapons not against the usa and not against the world

the people that ice will apprehend have already been ordered to be deported this means that they have run from the law and run from the courts these are people that are supposed to go back to their home country they broke the law by coming into the country now by staying
when people come into our country illegally they will be deported
stock market is on track to have the best june in over years thank you mr president wsj

iran cannot have nuclear weapons under the terrible obama plan they would have been on their way to nuclear in a short number of years and existing verification is not acceptable we are putting major additional sanctions on iran on monday i look forward to the day that
sanctions come off iran and they become a productive and prosperous nation again the sooner the better
at the request of democrats i have delayed the illegal immigration removal process deportation for two weeks to see if the democrats and republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border if not deportations start

i never called the strike against iran as people are incorrectly reporting i just stopped it from going forward at this time
i want to give the democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to asylum and loopholes this will fix the southern border together with the help that mexico is now giving us probably happen but worth a try two weeks and big deportation begins
wonderful church service at camp david thank you
when our country had no debt and built everything from highways to the military with cash we had a big system of tariffs now we allow other countries to steal our wealth treasure and jobs but no more the usa is doing great with unlimited upside into the future


china gets of its oil from the straight japan many other countries likewise so why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries many years for zero compensation all of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been
a dangerous journey we even need to be there in that the us has just become by far the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world the us request for iran is very simple no nuclear weapons and no further sponsoring of terror
despite a federal reserve that know what it is doing raised rates far too fast very low inflation other parts of world slowing lowering easing did large scale tightening billionmonth we are on course to have one of the best months of june in us history
think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right thousands of points higher on the dow and gdp in the or even now they stick like a stubborn child when we need rates cuts easing to make up for what other countries are doing against us blew it
stock market is heading for one of the best months june in the history of our country thank you mr president
iran leadership understand the words or they never have sadly the thing they do understand is strength and power and the usa is by far the most powerful military force in the world with trillion dollars invested over the last two years alone
the wonderful iranian people are suffering and for no reason at all their leadership spends all of its money on terror and little on anything else the us has not forgotten use of bombs which killed americans and wounded many more
very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality any attack by iran on anything american will be met with great and overwhelming force in some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration no more john kerry obama

in our history and the poverty index is also best number ever leagues and teams love coming to the white house i am a big fan of the american team and soccer but megan should win first before she talks finish the job we yet
invited megan or the team but i am now inviting the team win or lose megan should never disrespect our country the white house or our flag especially since so much has been done for her the team be proud of the flag that you wear the usa is doing great
the democrats should change the loopholes and asylum laws so lives will be saved at our southern border they said it was not a crisis at the border that it was all just now they admit that i was right but they must do something about it fix the laws now
the democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken and very dangerous immigration laws it can be done instantly

have been in office for many years the military is very important to me and at no time in my professional life has the us military been as strong as it is right thank you lindseygrahamsc
according to fake news and low ratings cnn say hearings could change impeachment because they have lost the impeachment debate say no and they are hoping that yet another do over after years and will turn things around
no collusion no obstruction robert mueller said he was done after his last minute news conference as later corrected now the dems want to give it another try does it ever end
the republican senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our southern border in addition to aid congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the crisis we must end incentives for smuggling children trafficking women and selling drugs
why the democrats in the house calling comey brennan clapper page and her fbi lover whose invaluable phone records were illegally deleted crooked hillary podesta ohr and nellie the gps fusion characters christopher steele the dnc their missing server
and all of the others who have leaked lied and did so many other terrible things how is it even possible that these people are not being brought forward because it is a rigged democrat con game and the fake and corrupt media loves every minute of it
ever since the passage of the super predator crime bill pushed hard by joebiden together with bill and crooked hillary clinton which inflicted great pain on many but especially the african american community democrats have tried and failed to pass criminal justice reform
they came to me asking for help and i got criminal justice reform passed with help from both republicans and democrats many said that nobody but president trump could have done this all previous administrations failed please ask why they failed to the candidates
these flyers depict policy on illegal immigration much can be
boring
nbcnews and msnbc should be ashamed of themselves for having such a horrible technical breakdown in the middle of the debate truly unprofessional and only worthy of a fake news organization which they are
just stopped in alaska and said hello to our great

i look forward to speaking with prime minister modi about the fact that india for years having put very high tariffs against the united states just recently increased the tariffs even further this is unacceptable and the tariffs must be withdrawn
thank you msnbc real professionals chucktodd
seems totally ridiculous that our government and indeed country cannot ask a basic question of citizenship in a very expensive detailed and important census in this case for i have asked the lawyers if they can delay the census no matter how long until the
united states supreme court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter can anyone really believe that as a great country we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a citizen only in america
bipartisan humanitarian aid bill for the southern border just passed a great job done by all now we must work to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum thank you also to mexico for the work being done on helping with illegal immigration a very big difference
all democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare how about taking care of american citizens first the end of that race
the stock market went up massively from the day after i won the election all the way up to the day that i took office because of the enthusiasm for the fact that i was going to be president that big stock market increase must be credited to me if hillary won a big crash
i am in japan at the representing our country well but i heard it was not a good day for sleepy joe or crazy bernie one is exhausted the other is nuts so the big deal
in poll i would be at with our great economy maybe the best ever if not for the phony witch hunt and the fake news media
after some very important meetings including my meeting with president xi of china i will be leaving japan for south korea with president moon while there if chairman kim of north korea sees this i would meet him at the borderdmz just to shake his hand and say hello
i had a great meeting with president xi of china yesterday far better than expected i agreed not to increase the already existing tariffs that we charge china while we continue to negotiate china has agreed that during the negotiation they will begin purchasing large
amounts of agricultural product from our great farmers at the request of our high tech companies and president xi i agreed to allow chinese company huawei to buy product from them which will not impact our national security importantly we have opened up negotiations
again with china as our relationship with them continues to be a very good one the quality of the transaction is far more important to me than speed i am in no hurry but things look very good there will be no reduction in the tariffs currently being charged to china
i am in south korea now president moon and i have our new trade deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced today i will visit with and speak to our troops and also go to the the dmz long planned my meeting with president moon went very well
the highly respected farm journal has just announced my approval rating with our great farmers at and that despite all of the fake corrupt news that they are forced to endure farmers have been unfairly treated for many years and that is turning around fast
the leaders of virtually every country that i met at the congratulated me on our great economy many countries are having difficulties on that score we have the best economy anywhere in the world with great unlimited potential looking into the future
leaving south korea after a wonderful meeting with chairman kim jong un stood on the soil of north korea an important statement for all and a great honor

so many amazing things happened over the last three days all or at least most of those things are great for the united states much was accomplished
cap best first half since wsj our country is doing great
congratulations to legislators in new jersey for not passing taxes that would have driven large numbers of high end taxpayers out of the state many were planning to leave will now be staying new york others should start changing their thought process on taxes fast
thank you to president moon of south korea for hosting the american delegation and me immediately following the very successful in japan while there it was great to call on chairman kim of north korea to have our very well covered meeting good things can happen for all
congratulations to prime minister abe of japan for hosting such a fantastic and well run there a thing that was missing or a mistake that was made perfect the people of japan must be very proud of their prime minister

my opinion the president has done more good on the korean issue in the last year and a half than president obama did in eight years if you look at the strides they made during the obama years which advocated strategic patiencethey stuck their head in the sand this is
why president trump has to deal with north korea the way it is now he had to figure out what to do with the korea mess i think this is why the president deserves a lot of harry kazianis center for the national interest thank you
it is very hard and expensive to live in new york governor andrew cuomo uses his attorney general as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes they sue on everything always in search of a crime i even got sued on a foundation which took zero rent expenses gave away
more money than it had going on for years originally brought by crooked campaign chair ag eric schneiderman until forced to resign for abuse against women they never even looked at the disgusting clinton foundation now ag is harassing all of my
new york businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible so on top of ridiculously high taxes my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers no wonder people and businesses are fleeing new york in record numbers
right the trump foundation gave away plus with zero rent or expenses charged and has been being sued by cuomo and new york state for years another part of the political witch hunt just in case anyone is interested clinton foundation never even looked at
i am excited to announce that mercedesschlapp will soon be joining our campaign she feels so strongly about our country its future we are setting records in so many ways we will keep it going mercedes has done a fantastic job within the administration i am so thankful
it was great being with chairman kim jong un of north korea this weekend we had a great meeting he looked really well and very healthy i look forward to seeing him again soon
in the meantime our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems no rush but i am sure we will ultimately get there
i will be interviewed by tuckercarlson tonight at on foxnews
people are fleeing new york like never before if they own a business they are twice as likely to flee and if they are a victim of harassment by the ag of the state like what they are doing to our great nra which i think will move quickly to texas where they are loved
texas will defend them indemnify them against political harassment by new york state and governor cuomo so many people are leaving new york for texas and florida that it is totally under siege first new york taxes you too high then they sue you just to complete the job
mark levin has written a big number one bestselling book called conspicuously and accurately of the it is a great book that tells it like it is fake news and all keep this book number one
as most people are aware according to the polls i won every debate including the three with crooked hillary clinton despite the fact that in the first debate they modulated the sound on me and got caught this crew looks somewhat easier than crooked but you never know

our border patrol people are not hospital workers doctors or nurses the democrats bad immigration laws which could be easily fixed are the problem great job by border patrol above and beyond many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they
came from and in far safer conditions no matter how good things actually look even if perfect the democrat visitors will act shocked aghast at how terrible things are just pols if they really want to fix them change the immigration laws and loopholes so easy to do
now if you really want to fix the crisis at the southern border both humanitarian and otherwise tell migrants not to come into our country unless they are willing to do so legally and hopefully through a system based on merit this way we have no problems at all
if illegal immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers just tell them not to come all problems solved

strong jobs report low inflation and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the united states knowing that our federal reserve have a clue they raised rates too soon too often tightened while others did just the opposite
as well as we are doing from the day after the great election when the market shot right up it could have been even better massive additional wealth would have been created used very well our most difficult problem is not our competitors it is the federal reserve
joe biden is a reclamation project some things are just not salvageable china and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him he deserted our military our law enforcement and our healthcare added more debt than all other presidents combined win
sleepy joe biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising taxes if he becomes president ridiculously all democrats want to substantially raise taxes
last year was the first in years where prescription drug prices actually went down but things have been and are being put in place that will drive them down substantially if dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion we would get big results very fast
congratulations to the us soccer team on winning the world cup great and exciting play america is proud of you all
the fake news media in particular the failing nytimes is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the border detention centers first of all people should not be entering our country illegally only for us to then have to care for them we should be allowed to focus on
united states citizens first border patrol and others in law enforcement have been doing a great job we said there was a crisis the fake news the dems said it was now all agree we were right but they always knew that they are crowded which we
brought up not them because the dems change the loopholes and asylum big media con job
we are building the wall now but the reason the badly needed wall approved in the republican controlled house and senate was that we had a very slim majority in the senate needed democrat votes they were totally unwilling to give wall votes to us want open borders
watching foxnews weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings fake news cnn or brian williams remember when he totally fabricated a war story trying to make himself into a hero got fired a very dishonest journalist and the crew of degenerate
comcast nbcmsnbc trump haters who do whatever brian steve tell them to do like cnn nbc is also way down in the ratings but foxnews who failed in getting the very boring dem debates is now loading up with democrats even using fake unsourced nytimes as
a of information ask the times what they paid for the boston globe what they sold it for lost billion dollars or their old headquarters building disaster or their unfunded liability foxnews is changing fast but they forgot the people who got them there
impossible to believe that foxnews has hired donnabrazile the person fired by cnn after they tried to hide the bad facts failed for giving crooked hillary clinton the questions to a debate something unimaginable now she is all over fox including shep smith by far
their lowest rated show watch the foxnews weekend daytime anchors who are terrible go after her big time what they want but it sure is not what the audience wants

i have been very critical about the way the uk and prime minister theresa may handled brexit what a mess she and her representatives have created i told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way i do not know the ambassador but he is not liked or well
thought of within the us we will no longer deal with him the good news for the wonderful united kingdom is that they will soon have a new prime minister while i thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent state visit last month it was the queen who i was most impressed with
spoke to gopleader kevin mccarthy about the earthquakes in california and informed him that we will be working very closely on emergency funding also spoke to governor gavinnewsom all working together
very good numbers on the economy much potential for growth trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation we have been treated very unfairly to put it mildly by other countries for many years but that is changing
the wacky ambassador that the uk foisted upon the united states is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy he should speak to his country and prime minister may about their failed brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was
handled i told theresamay how to do that deal but she went her own foolish waywas unable to get it done a disaster i know the ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool tell him the usa now has the best economy military anywhere in the world by far
and they are both only getting bigger better and strongerthank you mr president

a truly great patriotic charitable man bernie marcus the cofounder of home depot who at the age of is coming under attack by the radical left democrats with one of their often used weapons they want people to shop at those great stores because he contributed
to your favorite president me these people are vicious and totally crazed but remember there are far more great people in this country than bad do to them what they do to you fight for bernie marcus and home depot

so now the obama appointed judge on the census case are you a citizen of the united states let the justice department use the lawyers that it wants to use could this be a first

robert johnson bet give the president a lot of credit for moving the economy in a positive direction benefiting a large number of americans i think the tax cuts clearly helped stimulate the economy overall if you look at the us economy and you look at
the number of people who are no longer looking for jobs but who are now seeing the opportunity for job growth got to give the president an a plus for thank you robert one of our great business leaders
the fake news media loves the narrative that i use many banks because the banks like me no i use many banks because i need their money old fashioned it if i did it would have been very easy for me to get
and remember a bank that i did use years ago the now badly written about and maligned deutsche bank was then one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world they wanted my business and so did many others
democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called in cages inhumane treatment at the because the horrible picture used was from the obama years very embarrassing foxandfriends
now the democrats have asked to see more people who have already spent hours with robert mueller and spent a fortune on lawyers in so doing how many bites at the apple do they get before working on border loopholes and asylum they also want to interview the highly
conflicted and compromised mueller again he said he was after his last minute speech and that he had nothing more to say outside of the no collusion no obstruction report enough already go back to work i won unanimously the big emoluments case yesterday

a big subject today at the white house social media summit will be the tremendous dishonesty bias discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies we will not let them get away with it much longer the fake news media will also be there but for a limited period
the fake news is not as important or as powerful as social media they have lost tremendous credibility since that day in november that i came down the escalator with the person who was to become your future first lady when i ultimately leave office in six
years or maybe or just kidding they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility or approval from the public why they will all be endorsing me at some point one way or the other could you imagine having sleepy joe biden or alfred e newman
or a very nervous and skinny version of pocahontas as your president rather than what you have now so great looking and smart a true stable genius sorry to say that even social media would be driven out of business along with and finally the fake news media

i am not a fan of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activity
similarly facebook will have little standing or dependability if facebook and other companies want to become a bank they must seek a new banking charter and become subject to all banking regulations just like other banks both national
and international we have only one real currency in the usa and it is stronger than ever both dependable and reliable it is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the world and it will always stay that way it is called the united states dollar
paul ryan the failed vp candidate former speaker of the house whose record of achievement was atrocious except during my first two years as president ultimately became a long running lame duck failure leaving his party in the lurch both as a fundraiser leader
when mitt chose paul i told people the end of that presidential run he quit congress because he know how to win they gave me standing in the great state of wisconsin booed him off the stage he promised me the wall failed happening anyway
he had the majority blew it away with his poor leadership and bad timing never knew how to go after the dems like they go after us get him out of congress fast enough

when you are the big that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed tariffs are a great negotiating tool a great revenue producer and most importantly a powerful way to get
companies to come to the usa and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home we stupidly lost of our auto business to mexico if the tariffs went on at the higher level they would all come back and fast but very happy with the deal i made
if mexico produces which i think they will biggest part of deal with mexico has not yet been revealed china is similar except they devalue currency subsidize companies to lessen effect of tariffs so far little effect to consumers companies will relocate to us
great job by rush limbaugh on foxandfriends

so interesting to see democrat congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe the worst most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world if they even have a functioning government at all now loudly
and viciously telling the people of the united states the greatest and most powerful nation on earth how our government is to be run why they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came then come back and show us how
it is done these places need your help badly you leave fast enough sure that nancy pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements
tour showed vividly to politicians and the media how well run and clean the detention centers are great reviews failing nytimes story was fake the adult single men areas were clean but crowded also loaded up with a big percentage of criminals
sorry let them into our country if too crowded tell them not to come to usa and tell the dems to fix the loopholes problem solved
pictwittercomyaicxrxyqq
so sad to see the democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our country and who in addition hate israel with a true and unbridled passion whenever confronted they call their adversaries including nancy pelosi their disgusting language
and the many terrible things they say about the united states must not be allowed to go unchallenged if the democrat party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in
we are doing great economically as a country number one despite the antiquated policy on rates and tightening much room to grow
quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than years the united states tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave china for nontariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving this is why china wants to make a deal
with the us and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place in the meantime we are receiving billions of dollars in tariffs from china with possibly much more to come these tariffs are paid for by china devaluing pumping not by the us taxpayer
when will the radical left congresswomen apologize to our country the people of israel and even to the office of the president for the foul language they have used and the terrible things they have said so many people are angry at them their horrible disgusting actions
if democrats want to unite around the foul language racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular unrepresentative congresswomen it will be interesting to see how it plays out i can tell you that they have made israel feel abandoned by the us
all know that aoc and this crowd are a bunch of communists they hate israel they hate our own country calling the guards along our border the border patrol agents concentration camp guards they accuse people who support israel as doing it for the
they are antisemitic they are antiamerica we need to know anything about them personally talk about their policies i think they are american citizens who are duly elected that are running on an agenda that is disgusting that the american people will reject
what does it mean for america to have free healthcare for illegal immigrants no criminalization of coming into our country see how that works for controlling immigration they talk about israel like a bunch of thugs not victims of the entire region they wanted
to impeach president trump on day one make them the face of the future of the democrat party you will destroy the democrat party their policies will destroy our lindseygrahamsc need i say more
here we go with the fake polls just like what happened with the election against crooked hillary clinton abc nbc cnn nytimes washingtonpost they all got it wrong on purpose suppression polls so early they will never learn
we will never be a socialist or communist country if you are not happy here you can leave it is your choice and your choice alone this is about love for america certain people hate our country
they are antiisrael pro alqaeda and comment on the attack people did radical left democrats want open borders which means drugs crime human trafficking and much more
detention facilities are not concentration camps america has never been stronger than it is now rebuilt military highest stock market ever lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before keep america great
the dems were trying to distance themselves from the four but now they are forced to embrace them that means they are endorsing socialism hate of israel and the usa not good for the democrats
the obama administration built the cages not the trump administration democrats must give us the votes to change bad immigration laws
make america great again

the democrat congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile hateful and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the house or senate yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the democrat party horrible antiisrael antiusa proterrorist public

those tweets were not racist i have a racist bone in my body the socalled vote to be taken is a democrat con game republicans should not show and fall into their trap this should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the democrat
congresswomen who i truly believe based on their actions hate our country get a list of the horrible things they have said omar is polling at cortez at nancy pelosi tried to push them away but now they are forever wedded to the democrat party see you in

yesterday it was my great honor to host our third annual made in america showcase at the

visible members of the house democrats who are now wedded to this bitterness and hate the republican vote was wow also this was the first time since that the speaker of the house was ruled out of order and broke the rules of the house quite a day
america if you hate our country you are free to leave the simple fact of the matter is the four congresswomen think that america is wicked in its origins they think that america is even more wicked now that we are all racist and evil entitled to their
opinion americans now entitled to my opinion i just think left wing cranks the reason there are directions on a shampoo bottle we should ignore them the has moved the democrat party substantially left and
they are destroying the democrat party appalled that so many of our presidential candidates are falling all over themselves to try to agree with the four horsewomen of the apocalypse entitled to say that wack louisiana senator john kennedy
the democrats in congress are getting nothing done not on drug pricing not on immigration not on infrastructure not on nothing sooo much opportunity yet all they want to do is go the american people are tired of the never ending witch hunt they want results now

it is amazing how the fake news media became over the chant her by a packed arena a record crowd in the great state of north carolina but is totally calm accepting of the most vile and disgusting statements made by the three radical left congresswomen
mainstream media which has lost all credibility has either officially or unofficially become a part of the radical left democrat party it is a sick partnership so pathetic to watch they even covered a tiny staged crowd as they greeted foul mouthed omar in minnesota a
thomas friedman a weak and pathetic sort of guy writes columns for the new york times in between rounds of his favorite game golf two weeks ago while speaking to a friend on his cell phone i unfortunately ended up speaking to friedman we spoke for a while and
he could not have been nicer or more respectful to your favorite president me then i saw the column he wrote will be reelected he called me a racist which i am not and said rhode island went from economically bad to great in years because the
governor of the state did a good job that may be true but she could not have done it without the tremendous economic success of our country the turnaround that my administration has caused really nasty to me in his average iq columns kissed my a on the call phony
because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the federal reserve we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically in other words our interest costs are much higher than other countries when they should be lower correct
i like new york fed president john williams first statement much better than his second his first statement is correct in that the fed far too fast too early also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening we are in a world competition winning big
but it is no thanks to the federal reserve had they not acted so fast and we would be doing even better than we are doing right now this is our chance to build unparalleled wealth and success for the us growth which would greatly reduce debt blow it
fed there is almost no inflation
just spoke to kanyewest about his friend aap incarceration i will be calling the very talented prime minister of sweden to see what we can do about helping aap rocky so many people would like to see this quickly resolved

presidential harassment

i believe the four congresswomen are capable of loving our country they should apologize to america and israel for the horrible hateful things they have said they are destroying the democrat party but are weak insecure people who can never destroy our great nation

senator chuck schumer has finally gone to the southern border with some democrat senators this is a great thing nearby he missed a large group of illegal immigrants trying to enter the usa illegally they wildly rushed border patrol some agents were badly injured
based on the comments made by senator schumer he must have seen how dangerous bad for our country the border is it is not a as the fake news media their democrat partners tried to portray he said he wants to meet i will set up a meeting asap

thank you very much for revealing the incredible facts which the fake news media will never do stevehiltonx

with almost no inflation our country is needlessly being forced to pay a much higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided federal reserve in addition quantitative tightening is continuing making it harder for our country to compete as good
as we have done it could have been soooo much better interest rate costs should have been much lower gdp our wealth accumulation much higher such a waste of time money also very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in
it is far more costly for the federal reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does in the future turn down very inexpensive in fact productive to move now the fed raised tightened far too much too fast in other words they missed it big miss it again
the amazon washington post front page story yesterday was total fake news they said wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four now really does that sound like me what advisors there were no talking points
except for those stated by me of were never given to me it is a made up story meant to demean belittle the post had no sources the facts remain the same that we have radical left congresswomen who have said very bad things about israel our country
the mainstream media is out of control they constantly lie and cheat in order to get their radical left democrat views out their for all to see it has never been this bad they have gone bonkers no longer care what is right or wrong this large scale false reporting is sick
fake news equals the enemy of the people
highly conflicted robert mueller should not be given another bite at the apple in the end it will be bad for him and the phony democrats in congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous witch hunt result of the mueller report no collusion no obstruction
but the questions should be asked why were all of people given immunity and why were the text messages of peter s and his lover lisa page deleted and destroyed right after they left mueller and after we requested themthis is illegal
the report of iran capturing cia spies is totally false zero truth just more lies and propaganda like their shot down drone put out by a religious regime that is badly failing and has no idea what to do their economy is dead and will get much worse iran is a total mess
going with first lady to pay our respects to justice stevens leaving now

just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a never trumper attorney to help robert mueller with his testimony before congress tomorrow what a disgrace to our system never heard of this before very unfair should not be allowed a rigged witch hunt
just watched rep eric swalwell be asked endless softball questions by marthamaccallum on foxnews about the phony witch hunt he was just forced out of the democrat presidential primary because he polled at zero fox sure what it used to be too bad
oh well we still have the great seanhannity who i hear has a really strong show tonight pm
congratulations to our new secretary of defense mark
the young leaders here today tpusa are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation it is a movement about reclaiming your future rebuilding your country restoring your destiny and renewing the values that are the true source of american
so robert mueller has now asked for his long time never trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers this all about his lawyer represented the server who got off free in the crooked hillary case this should not be allowed rigged witch hunt
so democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime try pinning it on a very innocent president and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our country they call it obstruction wrong why robert mueller investigate the investigators
it was never agreed that robert mueller could use one of his many democrat never trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers this was specifically not agreed to and i would never have agreed to it the greatest witch hunt in us history by far
why robert mueller his band of angry democrats spend any time investigating crooked hillary clinton james comey lisa page and her psycho lover peter s andy mccabe the beautiful ohr family fusion gps and many more including himself andrew w
so why the highly conflicted robert mueller investigate how and why crooked hillary clinton deleted and acid washed emails immediately after getting a subpoena from the united states congress she must have great lawyers
no collusion no obstruction
keep america great
it has been reported that robert mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of fbi director and get turned down the day before he was wrongfully appointed special counsel hope he say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the
interview including the vice president of the united states
has been a disaster for the democrats and a disaster for the reputation of robert chris wallace foxnews
was asked whether or not the investigation was impeded in any way and he said in other words there was no obstruction katiepavlich foxnews

pictwittercomtnxuyfqigd

the fact that i have gone through a three year vicious witch hunt perpetrated by the lamestream media in collusion with crooked and the democrat party there can be no way with the greatest economy in us history that i can be losing to the sleepy one keep america great
there may or may not be national security concerns with regard to google and their relationship with china if there is a problem we will find out about it i sincerely hope there is not

the wto is broken when the richest countries claim to be developing countries to avoid wto rules and get special treatment no more today i directed the us trade representative to take action so that countries stop cheating the system at the expense of the usa

wow big victory on the wall the united states supreme court overturns lower court injunction allows southern border wall to proceed big win for border security and the rule of law

rep elijah cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men women of border patrol about conditions at the southern border when actually his baltimore district is far worse and more dangerous his district is considered the worst in the usa
as proven last week during a congressional tour the border is clean efficient well run just very crowded cumming district is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess if he spent more time in baltimore maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous filthy place
why is so much money sent to the elijah cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the united states no human being would want to live there where is all this money going how much is stolen investigate this corrupt mess immediately
consideration is being given to declaring antifa the gutless radical left wack jobs who go around hitting only nonfighters people over the heads with baseball bats a major organization of terror along with others would make it easier for police to do their job
the democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly irrevocably tarnished witch hunt hoax until robert mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude incompetence that the halls of congress have ever seen truth is he had no facts on his side nothing he could do
the dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible mueller performance and are starting to spin impeachment all over again how sick disgusting and bad for our country are they what they are doing is so wrong but they do it anyway dems have become the do nothing party
such a big victory of our country court approves trump administration plan to use military funds for the foxnews we will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure over time by other countries
democrats care about border security they refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the loopholes and asylum would be so easy they want open borders which means crimecrimecrime
we gave nadler and his trump hating dems the complete mueller report we have to and even mueller himself but now that both were a total bust they say it good enough nothing will ever be good enough for them witch hunt
no collusion no obstruction total exoneration democrat witch hunt
repcummings why you focus on your
thanks
thank you

thank you
of the biggest things to come out of testimony was the fact that when he was asked was there anything that impeded your investigation the answer was a clear unequivocal misty marris foxnews true but many other great things came out
robert testimony and the mueller report itself was a disaster for this illegal democrat inspired witch hunt it is an embarrassment to the usa that they know how to stop they help themselves they are totally lost they are clowns
so sad that elijah cummings has been able to do so little for the people of baltimore statistically baltimore ranks last in almost every major category cummings has done nothing but milk baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing
the real collusion the conspiracy the crime was between the clinton campaign the dnc fusion gps christopher steeleand many others including comey mccabe lisa page and her lover ohr and his wonderful wife and on and on replouiegohmert
the democrats are still doing the russians dirty work as they continue to push the fake crime media credibility is now shot democrat credibility is shot wasted over hearings on a hoax done nothing on infrastructure drug prices trade jessebwatters

it for donald trump we would never know how corrupt these democrats are we would never know for sure that there was a deep state now we know judgejeanine
someone please explain to nancy pelosi who was recently called racist by those in her own party that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that congressman elijah cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the city of baltimore just take
a look the facts speak far louder than words the democrats always play the race card when in fact they have done so little for our great african american people now lowest unemployment in us history and only getting better elijah cummings has failed badly
speaking of failing badly has anyone seen what is happening to nancy district in san francisco it is not even recognizeable lately something must be done before it is too late the dems should stop wasting time on the witch hunt hoax and start focusing on our country
cummings has had his chance to address it crime conditions in baltimore for decades and he gotten it petehegseth foxandfriends how can he get it done when he just wants to use his oversight committee to hurt innocent people and divide our country
there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of baltimore itself dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts shame
if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership his radical is a joke
under the trump administration african american unemployment is the lowest best in the history of the united states no president has come close to doing this before i also created successful opportunity zones waiting for nancy and elijah to say you mr
i am pleased to announce that highly respected congressman john ratcliffe of texas will be nominated by me to be the director of national intelligence a former us attorney john will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loves dan coats the current director will
be leaving office on august i would like to thank dan for his great service to our country the acting director will be named shortly
the democrats would have closed the loopholes two years ago when president trump asked them to do so none of this stuff would have thomashomanice
democrats hate this president so much forgetting about their duty to secure our thomashomanice stevehiltonx sad but true
law enforcement is at the scene of shootings in gilroy california reports are that shooter has not yet been apprehended be careful and safe
baltimore under the leadership of elijah cummings has the worst crime statistics in the nation years of all talk no action so tired of listening to the same old bullnext reverend al will show up to complain protest nothing will get done for the people in need sad
if the democrats are going to defend the radical left and king baltimore fail it will be a long road to the good news for the dems is that they have the fake news media in their pocket
al sharpton would always ask me to go to his events he would say a personal favor to seldom but sometimes i would go it was fine he came to my office in tt during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me just a conman at work
the eu and china will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product in the meantime and with very low inflation our fed does nothing and probably will do very little by comparison too bad
crazy bernie sanders recently equated the city of baltimore to a third world country based on that statement i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist just as a republican would if he used that term and standard the fact is baltimore can be brought back maybe
even to new heights of success and glory but not with king elijah and that crew when the leaders of baltimore want to see the city rise again i am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call
the fed way too early and way too much their quantitative tightening was another big mistake while our country is doing very well the potential wealth creation that was missed especially when measured against our debt is staggering we are competing with other
countries that know how to play the game against the us actually why the eu was formedand for china until now the us has been the fed has made all of the wrong moves a small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway
looking forward to my meeting at pm with wonderful inner city pastors
the republican party has a new star his name is daniel cameron djaycameron and he is running for attorney general of the commonwealth of kentucky
he is tough on crime strong on borders and will fight for our second amendment daniel will never let you down he has my full and complete endorsement
just remember the iranians never won a war but never lost a negotiation
elijah cummings never even went to the southern border and then he screams at the very good people who despite congresses failure to fix the loopholes and asylum make it work crossings are way down and the wall is being built even with zero dem help border getting strong
numbers are the worst in the united states on crime and the economy billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail the money was stolen or wasted ask elijah cummings where it went he should investigate himself with his oversight committee
know what going to take a lot of democratic run cities all over america look like this not just baltimore kimberly klacik baltimore journalist remember vote for trump what the h do you have to lose best unemployment numbers
despite the democrats wanting very unsafe open borders refusing to change the loopholes asylum tremendous progress is being made the the southern border we all waited because we assumed the dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible immigration lawsthey
china is doing very badly worst year in was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now no signs that they are doing so that is the problem with china they just come through our economy has become much larger than the chinese economy is last years
my team is negotiating with them now but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit they should probably wait out our election to see if we get one of the democrat stiffs like sleepy joe then they could make a great deal like in past years and continue
to ripoff the usa even bigger and better than ever before the problem with them waiting however is that if when i win the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating nowor no deal at all we have all the cards our past leaders never got it
wow morning joe psycho ratings have really crashed very small audience people are tired of hearing fake news delivered with an anger that is not to be believed sad when the show was sane they helped get me elected thanks was on all the time lost all of its juice

wow a federal judge in the southern district of ny completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the democratic national committee against our historic campaign for president the judge said the dnc case was from the facts yet another total complete
vindication exoneration from the russian wikileaks and every other form of hoax perpetrated by the dnc radical democrats and others this is really big especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by president clinton the witch hunt ends
such a great victory in court yesterday on the russian hoax the greatest political scam in the history of our country treason hopefully the attorney generel of the united states and all of those working with him will find out in great detail what happened never again
if i won the election we would be in a great recessiondepression right now the people i saw on stage last night you can add in sleepy joe harris the rest will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before with me only up
lesser of two socialists is still a senator john kennedy of louisiana
don lemon the dumbest man on television insinuated last night while asking a debate that i was a racist when in fact i am least racist person in the perhaps someone should explain to don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased fair
or is he too dumb stupid to understand that no wonder ratings also have gone down the tubes and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom hold your breath
the prosecutors who lost the case against seal eddie gallagher who i released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly were ridiculously given a navy achievement medal not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect
to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion i have directed the secretary of the navy richard spencer chief of naval operations john richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards
i am very happy for eddie gallagher and his family
what the market wanted to hear from jay powell and the federal reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive ratecutting cycle which would keep pace with china the european union and other countries around the world
as usual powell let us down but at least he is ending quantitative tightening which have started in the first place no inflation we are winning anyway but i am certainly not getting much help from the federal reserve
the radical left dems went after me for using the words concerning baltimore take a look at elijah
very low ratings for the democratic debate last night desperate for trump
experts stated that the fed should not have tightened and then waited too long to undo their mistake james bullard of st louis fed said they waited too long to correct the mistake that they made last december powell cut rate and then he started loudobbs
the cages for kids were built by the obama administration in he had the policy of child separation i ended it even as i realized that more families would then come to the border cnn
the people on the stage tonight and last were not those that will either make america great again or keep america great our country now is breaking records in almost every category from stock market to military to unemployment we have prosperity success like never before
it will soon be time to choose to keep and build upon that prosperity and success or let it go we are respected again all around the world keep it that way i said i will never let you down and i we will only grow bigger better and stronger together
china iran other foreign countries are looking at the democrat candidates and over the small prospect that they could be dealing with them in the not too distant future they would be able to rip off our beloved usa like never before with president trump no way
budget deal is phenomenal for our great military our vets and jobs jobs jobs two year deal gets us past the election go for it republicans there is always plenty of time to cut
big rally tonight in cincinnati ohio see you there ps our country is doing great

a string of court cases that have been run through the legal system that have hit dead ends billhemmer

our representatives have just returned from china where they had constructive talks having to do with a future trade deal we thought we had a deal with china three months ago but sadly china decided to renegotiate the deal prior to signing more recently china agreed to
buy agricultural product from the us in large quantities but did not do so additionally my friend president xi said that he would stop the sale of fentanyl to the united states this never happened and many americans continue to die trade talks are continuing and
during the talks the us will start on september putting a small additional tariff of on the remaining billion dollars of goods and products coming from china into our country this does not include the billion dollars already tariffed at
we look forward to continuing our positive dialogue with china on a comprehensive trade deal and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one

i would like to thank two great iowa senators chuckgrassley and senjoniernst for their support today on the spending bill their vote and the vote of other republicans and democrats helped get this done in a bipartisan fashion thank you all
really bad news the baltimore house of elijah cummings was robbed too bad
kim jong un and north korea tested short range missiles over the last number of days these missiles tests are not a violation of our signed singapore agreement nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands there may be a united nations violation but
chairman kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust there is far too much for north korea to gain the potential as a country under kim jong leadership is unlimited also there is far too much to lose i may be wrong but i believe that
chariman kim has a great and beautiful vision for his country and only the united states with me as president can make that vision come true he will do the right thing because he is far too smart not to and he does not want to disappoint his friend president trump
aap rocky released from prison and on his way home to the united states from sweden it was a rocky week get home asap aap
our great republican congressman john ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the lamestream media rather than going through months of slander and libel i explained to john how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people
john has therefore decided to stay in congress where he has done such an outstanding job representing the people of texas and our country i will be announcing my nomination for dni shortly
nice to see that one of my best pupils is still a giant trump fan steve joined me after i won the primaries but i loved working with himpictwittercomjrpmdrgytb
countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate real trade deals not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations they want to be targeted for tariffs by the us
things are going along very well with china they are paying us tens of billions of dollars made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going so far our consumer is paying nothing and no inflation no help from fed
terrible shootings in elpaso texas reports are very bad many killed working with state and local authorities and law enforcement spoke to governor to pledge total support of federal government god be with you all
shooting in el paso texas was not only tragic it was an act of cowardice i know that i stand with everyone in this country to condemn hateful act there are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people
melania and i send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of texas
the fbi local and state law enforcement are working together in el paso and in dayton ohio information is rapidly being accumulated in dayton much has already be learned in el paso law enforcement was very rapid in both instances updates will be given throughout the day
god bless the people of el paso texas god bless the people of dayton ohio
today i authorized the lowering of the flags to halfstaff at all federal government buildings in honor of the victims of the tragedies in el paso texas and dayton ohio
the flags at the white house will be lowered today through thursday august melania and i are praying for all those impacted by this unspeakable act of evil
we cannot let those killed in el paso texas and dayton ohio die in vain likewise for those so seriously wounded we can never forget them and those many who came before them republicans and democrats must come together and get strong background checks perhaps marrying
this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform we must have something good if not great come out of these two tragic events
the media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our country fake news has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years news coverage has got to start being fair balanced and unbiased or these terrible problems will only get worse
china dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low called are you listening federal reserve this is a major violation which will greatly weaken china over time
based on the historic currency manipulation by china it is now even more obvious to everyone that americans are not paying for the tariffs they are being paid for compliments of china and the us is taking in tens of billions of dollars china has always
used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories hurt our jobs depress our wages and harm our prices not anymore
china is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the us with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation so onesided it should have been stopped many years ago
the first lady and i join all americans in praying and grieving for the victims their families and the survivors we will stand by their side foreverpictwittercomzoqlvauxoh
today i am also directing the department of justice to propose legislation ensuring that those who commit hate crimes and mass murders face the death penalty and that this capital punishment be delivered quickly decisively and without years of needless
we must honor the sacred memory of those we have lost by acting as one people open wounds cannot heal if we are divided we must seek real bipartisan solutions that will truly make america safer and better for

sundarpichai of google was in the oval office working very hard to explain how much he liked me what a great job the administration is doing that google was not involved with military that they help crooked hillary over me in the election that they
are not planning to illegally subvert the election despite all that has been said to the contrary it all sounded good until i watched kevin cernekee a google engineer say terrible things about what they did in and that they want to sure that trump losses
in lou dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the american public peterschweizer stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on hillary clinton and boosted negative stories on donald trump all very illegal we are watching google very closely
will be going to dayton ohio and el paso texas tomorrow to meet with first responders law enforcement and some of the victims of the terrible shootings
is trying to meddle with a ballot in order to oppose president trump and clearly something california is not allowed to do it violates the right of the republican party or any party to choose its leaders under the free speech clause and under the
john yoo ingrahamangle former governor jerry brown vetoed the same bill in that it was ridiculous and totally unconstitutional just more of the record setting presidential harassment feel badly new york state is far worse
beto phony name to indicate hispanic heritage who is embarrassed by my last visit to the great state of texas where i trounced him and is now even more embarrassed by polling at in the democrat primary should respect the victims law enforcement be quiet
south korea has agreed to pay substantially more money to the united states in order to defend itself from north korea over the past many decades the us has been paid very little by south korea but last year at the request of president trump south korea paid
talks have begun to further increase payments to the united states south korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the united states of america the relationship between the two countries is a very good one
urges unity vs was the correct description in the first headline by the failing new york times but it was quickly changed to hate but not after the radical left democrats went absolutely crazy fake news what up against
is an astounding development in journalism never seen it happen before just never seen anything like this is that journalism today i think mark penn former clinton advisor tuckercarlson after years i almost got a good headline from the times
the dayton ohio shooter had a history of supporting political figures like bernie sanders elizabeth warren and oann i hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to fake news thank you
more central banks cut our problem is not china we are stronger than ever money is pouring into the us while china is losing companies by the thousands to other countries and their currency is under siege our problem is a federal reserve that is too
proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much and that i was right they must cut rates bigger and faster and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening now yield curve is at too wide a margin and no inflation incompetence is a
terrible thing to watch especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily we will win anyway but it would be much easier if the fed understood which they that we are competing against other countries all of whom want to do well at our expense
watching sleepy joe biden making a speech sooo boring the lamestream media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy it will be over for them not to mention the fact that our country will do poorly with him it will be one big crash but at least china will be happy
just left dayton ohio where i met with the victims families law enforcement medical staff first responders it was a warm wonderful visit tremendous enthusiasm even love then i saw failed presidential candidate sherrod brown mayor whaley totally
misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital their news conference after i left for el paso was a fraud it bore no resemblance to what took place with those incredible people that i was so lucky to meet and spend time with they were all amazingo
watching fake news cnn is better than watching shepard smith the lowest rated show on foxnews actually whenever possible i turn to oann

just watched a world class loser tim who i seen or spoken to in many years knows nothing about me except that he wrote a failed hit piece book about me years ago fired like a dog from other jobs saw him on brian williams trump slam show bad tv
i am so amazed that msnbc cnn can keep putting on over and over again people that have no idea what i am all about and yet they speak as experts on same people since long before the election and how did that work out for the haters and losers not well
as your president one would think that i would be thrilled with our very strong dollar i am not the high interest rate level in comparison to other countries is keeping the dollar high making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like caterpillar boeing
john deere our car companies others to compete on a level playing field with substantial fed cuts there is no inflation and no quantitative tightening the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition we have the greatest companies
in the world there is nobody even close but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our federal reserve they have called it wrong at every step of the way and we are still winning can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right
iran is in serious financial trouble they want desperately to talk to the us but are given mixed signals from all of those purporting to represent us including president macron of france
i know emmanuel means well as do all others but nobody speaks for the united states but the united states itself no one is authorized in any way shape or form to represent us
sue gordon is a great professional with a long and distinguished career i have gotten to know sue over the past years and have developed great respect for her sue has announced she will be leaving on august which
coincides with the retirement of dan coats a new acting director of national intelligence will be named shortly
i am pleased to inform you that the honorable joseph maguire current director of the national counterterrorism center will be named acting director of national intelligence effective august admiral maguire has a long and distinguished
career in the military retiring from the us navy in he commanded at every level including the naval special warfare command he has also served as a national security fellow at harvard university i have no doubt he will do a great job
rod blagojevich the former governor of illinois was sentenced to years in prison he has served years many people have asked that i study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one white house staff is continuing the review of this matter
serious discussions are taking place between house and senate leadership on meaningful background checks i have also been speaking to the nra and others so that their very strong views can be fully represented and respected guns should not be placed in the hands of
mentally ill or deranged people i am the biggest second amendment person there is but we all must work together for the good and safety of our country common sense things can be done that are good for everyone
liberal hollywood is racist at the highest level and with great anger and hate they like to call themselves but they are not elite in fact it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the elite the movie coming out is made in order
to inflame and cause chaos they create their own violence and then try to blame others they are the true racists and are very bad for our country
maggie haberman of the failing nytimes reported that i was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in dayton el paso when in fact i was the one who stated very strongly that i want the fake news inside told my people not to let them in fake reporting
in a letter to me sent by kim jong un he stated very nicely that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint ussouth korea joint exercise are over it was a long letter much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises it was
also a small apology for testing the short range missiles and that this testing would stop when the exercises end i look forward to seeing kim jong un in the not too distant future a nuclear free north korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world
never has the press been more inaccurate unfair or corrupt we are not fighting the democrats they are easy we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged lamestream media they have gone totally crazy make america great again
got to see by accident wacko comedian bill show so many lies he said patients in el paso hospital want to meet with me wrong had really great meetings with numerous patients said i was on vacation wrong long planned fix up of wh stay here rather than
cause big disruption by going to manhattan working almost all of the time including evenings have to be in wh to do thatand sooo many other false statements he is right about one thing though i will win again in otherwise he pays in taxes
china wants to make a deal so badly thousands of companies are leaving because of the tariffs they must stem the flow at the same time china may be hoping for a democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of america the theft of hundreds of billions of
think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show to so many how totally dishonest the fake news media really is it may be the most corrupt and disgusting business almost there is make america great again
joe biden just said believe in facts not does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president we are in a very big and complicated world joe have a clue
anthony scaramucci who was quickly terminated days from a position that he was totally incapable of handling now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on like many other socalled television experts he knows very little about me
other than the fact that this administration has probably done more than any other administration in its first years of existence anthony who would do anything to come back in should remember the only reason he is on tv and not for being the mooch
so funny to watch little donny deutsch on tv with his own failing show when i did the apprentice donny would call me along with erinburnett others and beg to be on that very successful show he had the tv i would let him come on though he erin had very little
tv talent then during the election i would watch as joe scarborough his very angry psycho wife would push donny to the point of total humiliation he would never fight back because he wanted to stay on tv even on a very low rated show all in the name of ambition
many incredible things are happening right now for our country after years of being ripped off by other nations on both trade deals and the military things are changing fast big progress is being made america is respected again keep america great
scaramucci who like so many others had nothing to do with my election victory is only upset that i want him back in the administration where he desperately wanted to be also i seldom had time to return his many calls to me he just wanted to be on tv
the united states is learning much from the failed missile explosion in russia we have similar though more advanced technology the russian explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond not good
curt schilling a great pitcher and patriot is considering a run for congress in arizona terrific foxandfriends
through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system the tens of billions of dollars that the us is receiving is a gift from china prices not up no inflation farmers getting more than china would be spending fake news report
would chris cuomo be given a red flag for his recent rant filthy language and a total loss of control he be allowed to have any weapon nuts
as usual china said they were going to be buying from our great american farmers so far they have not done what they said maybe this will be different
all the news not fit to print new york times is no longer the paper we grew up with it is no longer a news organization it is now an agenda driven organization out to change the country for the michael goodwin highly respected new york post columnist
many are blaming me and the united states for the problems going on in hong kong i imagine why
our intelligence has informed us that the chinese government is moving troops to the border with hong kong everyone should be calm and safe
just landed in pennsylvania looking forward to making a speech on energy so important
it always happens when a conservative does even a fraction of what chris cuomo did with his lunatic ranting raving cursing they get destroyed by the fake news but when a liberal democrat like chris cuomo does it republicans immediately come to his defense we never learn
no debate on election security should go forward without first agreeing that voter id identification must play a very strong part in any final agreement without voter id it is all so meaningless
great day in the incredible commonwealth of pennsylvania today with the amazing energy workers construction workers and craft workers who make america run and who make america proud no one in the world does it better than youpictwittercomjfwgyjzwkm
great interview of ron vitiello former acting ice director by jessebwatters on foxnews about all of the work that is being has been done on our southern border thanks ron terrific job now if only the democrats would fix the loopholes asylum
fed has got to do something the fed is the central bank of the united states not the central bank of the mark grant varneyco correct the federal reserve acted far too quickly and now is very very late too bad so much to gain on the upside
far had tariffs imposed on billion dollars worth of chinese products but you tell me that it has hurt our economy it really led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer varneyco foxbusiness and we are taking in billions
tremendous amounts of money pouring into the united states people want safety
the great charles payne cvpayne correctly stated that fed chair jay powell made two enormous mistakes when he said cycle data dependent did not do the right i agree to put it mildly varneyco
we are winning big time against china companies jobs are fleeing prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down china is not our problem though hong kong is not helping our problem is with the fed raised too much too fast now too slow to cut
spread is way too much as other countries say thank you to clueless jay powell and the federal reserve germany and many others are playing the game crazy inverted yield curve we should easily be reaping big rewards gains but the fed is holding us back we will win
good things were stated on the call with china the other day they are eating the tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and money into their system the american consumer is fine with or without the september date but much good will come from the short
deferral to december it actually helps china more than us but will be reciprocated millions of jobs are being lost in china to other nontariffed countries thousands of companies are leaving of course china wants to make a deal let them work humanely with hong kong first
i know president xi of china very well he is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people he is also a good man in a i have zero doubt that if president xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the hong kong problem he can do it personal meeting
go out and get andrew new book of became the investigator and when they pushed the envelope there was nobody there to tell them no it goes right to the president obama plenty of information that obama was informed knew exactly
what they were doing plenty of indication we have to stevedoocy cow got to read this ainsleyearhardt foxandfriends a very serious situation can never be allowed to happen again drain the swamp
the philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets he had a long and very dangerous criminal record looked like he was having a good time after his capture and after wounding so many police long sentence must get much tougher on street crime
it would show great weakness if israel allowed rep omar and reptlaib to visit they hate israel all jewish people there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds minnesota and michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office they are a disgrace
the united states is now by far the biggest strongest and most powerful economy in the world it is not even close as others falter we will only get stronger consumers are in the best shape ever plenty of cash business optimism is at an all time high
our great farmers know how important it is to win on trade they will be the big winners
wow the deputy editor of the failing new york times was just demoted should have been fired totally biased and inaccurate reporting the paper is a fraud zero credibility fake news takes another hit but this time a big one
representatives omar and tlaib are the face of the democrat party and they hate israel
the fake news media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my reelection the problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on trade and everyone knows that including china
they get this trade deal with the us done china could have it first recession or worse in years disinvestment in china right now also the fed is too tight i steve moore heritage foundation
walmart a great indicator as to how the us is doing just released outstanding numbers our country unlike others is doing great let the fake news convince you otherwise
thank you to my good friend chuck canterbury for years of service to the fraternal order of police and our great men and women in blue you are an incredible patriot

pictwittercomfjppavmluz

israel was very respectful nice to rep rashida tlaib allowing her permission to visit her as soon as she was granted permission she grandstanded loudly proclaimed she would not visit israel could this possibly have been a setup israel acted appropriately
rep tlaib wrote a letter to israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother permission was quickly granted whereupon tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup the only real winner here is grandmother she have to see her now
like it or not tlaib and omar are fast becoming the face of the democrat party cortez aoc is fuming not happy about this
just completed a very good meeting on afghanistan many on the opposite side of this year war and us are looking to make a deal if possible

major consideration is being given to naming antifa an of portland is being watched very closely hopefully the mayor will be able to properly do his job
the failing new york times in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history got caught by a leaker that they are shifting from their phony russian collusion narrative the mueller report his testimony were a total disaster to a racism witch hunt
with all that this administration has accomplished think what my poll numbers would be if we had an honest media which we do not
make america great again
we are doing very well with china and talking
juan williams at foxnews is so pathetic and yet when he met me in the fox building lobby he have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family yet he is always nasty and wrong
our economy is the best in the world by far lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories poised for big growth after trade deals are completed import prices down china eating tariffs helping targeted farmers from big tariff money coming in great future for usa
house democrats want to take action against israel because it is fighting back against two maybe four people that have said unthinkably bad things about it the israeli people dems have such disdain for israel what happened aoc plus is the new face of the democrat party
the new york times will be out of business soon after i leave office hopefully in years they have zero credibility and are losing a fortune even now especially after their massive unfunded liability fairly certain endorse me just to keep it all going
great cohesion inside the republican party the best i have ever seen despite all of the fake news my poll numbers are great new internal polls show them to be the strongest had so far think what be if i got fair media coverage
anthony scaramucci is a highly unstable who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign i barely knew him until his days of gross incompetencemade a fool of himself bad on tv abused staff
got fired wrote a very nice book about me just recently now the book is a lie said his wife was driving him crazy was happening with her getting divorced he was a mental wreck we want him around now fake news puts him on like he was my buddy
democrats want open borders and crime so dangerous for our country but we are building a big beautiful new wall i will protect america the dems know where to
our economy is very strong despite the horrendous lack of vision by jay powell and the fed but the democrats are trying to the economy to be bad for purposes of the election very selfish our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world
the fed rate over a fairly short period of time should be reduced by at least basis points with perhaps some quantitative easing as well if that happened our economy would be even better and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhancedgood for everyone
wow report just out google manipulated from million to million votes for hillary clinton in election this was put out by a clinton supporter not a trump supporter google should be sued my victory was even bigger than thought judicialwatch

speed bump has been missteps by the federal cvpayne foxandfriends so true
the fake news lamestream media is doing everything possible the a us recession even though the numbers facts are working totally in the opposite direction they would be willing to hurt many people but that matter to them our economy is sooo strong sorry
doing great with china and other trade deals the only problem we have is jay powell and the fed like a golfer who putt has no touch big us growth if he does the right thing big cut but count on him so far he has called it wrong and only let us down
we are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate and we should be lower than them yesterday dollar in no inflation wake up federal reserve such growth potential almost like never before
my proposal to the politically correct automobile companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than while at the same time making the cars substantially safer engines would run smoother very little impact on the environment foolish executives
so germany is paying zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money while the us a far stronger and more important credit is paying interest and just stopped i hope quantitative tightening strongest dollar in history very tough on exports no inflation
where is the federal reserve
for the record denmark is only at of gdp for nato spending they are a wealthy country and should be at we protect europe and yet only of the nato countries are at the mark the united states is at a much much higher level than that
because of me these countries have agreed to pay one hundred billion dollars more but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided sorry
nato very unfair to the united statespictwittercomyigmtkpscu
the legendary henry ford and alfred p sloan the founders of ford motor company and general motors are at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good and cost more to consumers crazy
henry ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modernday descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and work as well because execs want to fight california regulators car companies should know
that when this alternative is no longer available california will squeeze them to a point of business ruin only reason california is now talking to them is because the feds are giving a far better alternative which is much better for consumers
great loudobbs interviewed on seanhannity tonight at pm foxnews

germany sells year bonds offering negative yields germany competes with the usa our federal reserve does not allow us to do what we must do they put us at a disadvantage against our competition strong dollar no inflation they move like quicksand fight or go home
the economy is doing really well the federal reserve can easily make it record setting the question is being asked why are we paying much more in interest than germany and certain other countries be early for a change not late let america win big rather than just win

approval rating within the republican party thank you
the economy is strong and good whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well despite this the fake news media together with their partner the democrat party are working overtime to convince people that we are in or will soon be going into a recession they are
willing to lose their wealth or a big part of it just for the possibility of winning the election but it work because i always find a way to win especially for the people the greatest political movement in the history of our country will have another big win in
now the fed can show their stuff
as usual the fed did nothing it is incredible that they can without knowing or asking what i am doing which will be announced shortly we have a very strong dollar and a very weak fed i will work with both and the us will do great
my only question is who is our bigger enemy jay powell or chairman xi
our country has lost stupidly trillions of dollars with china over many years they have stolen our intellectual property at a rate of hundreds of billions of dollars a year they want to continue i let that happen we need china and frankly would be far
better off without them the vast amounts of money made and stolen by china from the united states year after year for decades will and must stop our great american companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to china including bringing
your companies home and making your products in the usa i will be responding to tariffs this afternoon this is a great opportunity for the united states also i am ordering all carriers including fed ex amazon ups and the post office to search for refuse
all deliveries of fentanyl from china or anywhere else fentanyl kills americans a year president xi said this would stop it our economy because of our gains in the last years is much larger than that of china we will keep it that way
the dow is down points perhaps on the news that representative seth moulton whoever that may be has dropped out of the presidential race
for many years china and many other countries has been taking advantage of the united states on trade intellectual property theft and much more our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to china with no end in sight
sadly past administrations have allowed china to get so far ahead of fair and balanced trade that it has become a great burden to the american taxpayer as president i can no longer allow this to happen in the spirit of achieving fair trade we must balance this very
unfair trading relationship china should not have put new tariffs on billion dollars of united states product politically motivated starting on october the billion dollars of goods and products from china currently being taxed at will be taxed at
additionally the remaining billion dollars of goods and products from china that was being taxed from september at will now be taxed at thank you for your attention to this matter
just spoke with president jairbolsonaro of brazil our future trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong perhaps stronger than ever before i told him if the united states can help with the amazon rainforest fires we stand ready to assist
thank you to diamondandsilk for the really nice words and thoughts on loudobbs tonight hosted by friend davidasmanfox great job by all ps check out these two great women on tour tomorrow night in nyc at the marriott marquis hotel broadway have fun
for all of the fake news reporters that have a clue as to what the law is relative to presidential powers china etc try looking at the emergency economic powers act of case closed
when i looked up to the sky and jokingly said am the chosen at a press conference two days ago referring to taking on trade with china little did i realize that the media would claim that i had a they knew i was kidding being sarcastic and just
having fun i was smiling as i looked up and around the many reporters with me were smiling also they knew the truthand yet when i saw the reporting cnn msnbc and other fake news outlets covered it as serious news me thinking of myself as the messiah no more trust
it you probably got a tax this was a new york times headline and it is very true if republicans take back the house and keep the senate and presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income tax cut democrats only want to raise your taxes

france and president emmanuelmacron have done a really great job thus far with a very important lunch with emmanuel was the best meeting we have yet had likewise evening meeting with world leaders went very well progress being made
the media is destroying the free press mark levin so true
before i arrived in france the fake and disgusting news was saying that relations with the others countries in the are very tense and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster just like they are trying to force a recession they are trying to america into
bad economic times the worse the better anything to make my election more difficult to win well we are having very good meetings the leaders are getting along very well and our country economically is doing great the talk of the world
such false and inaccurate reporting thus far on the the fake news knows this but they help themselves leaving now to have breakfast with boris j

the story by axios that president trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous i never said this just more fake news

axios whatever that is sat back and said geeeee see what can we make up today to embarrass the president then they said we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do the media in our country is totally out of control
can you believe it at approval in the republican party and have three stooges running against me one is appalachian who was actually in argentina for bad reasons

our federal reserve cannot keep up with the competition other countries at the in france all of the other leaders were giddy about how low their interest costs have gone germany is actually to borrow money zero interest plus no clue fed
puerto rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth their political system is broken and their politicians are either incompetent or corrupt congress approved billions of dollars last time more than anyplace else has ever gotten and it is sent to crooked pols no good
and by the way the best thing ever happened to puerto rico
another totally fake story in the amazon washington post lobbyist which states that if my aides broke the law to build the wall which is going up rapidly i would give them a pardon this was made up by the washington post only in order to demean and disparage fake news

a sad day for the democrats kirsten gillibrand has dropped out of the presidential primary glad they never found out that she was the one i was really afraid of
the amazon washington post and cnn just did a fake interview on pardons for aids on the wall and that i think the wall on the southern border was that important to stop illegals wanting to come into our country wrong vitally important will make a big impact so bad
there has never been a time in the history of our country that the media was so fraudulent fake or corrupt when the of is looked back on many years from now i only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the fake news
puerto rico is in great shape with hurricane dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated thank you to fema first responders and all for working so hard being so well prepared a great result the bad news florida get ready storm is building and will be big

crazy lawrence who has been calling me wrong from even before i announced my run for the presidency even being previously forced by nbc to apologize which he did while crying for things he said about me the apprentice was again forced to apologize this time
for the most ridiculous claim of all that russia russia russia or russian oligarchs cosigned loan documents for me a guarantee totally false as is virtually everything else he and much of the rest of the lamestream media has said about me for years all apologize
the totally inaccurate reporting by lawrence for which he has been forced by nbc to apologize is no different than the horrible corrupt and fraudulent fake news that i and many millions of great supporters have had to put up with for years so bad for the usa
the economy is doing great with tremendous upside potential if the fed would do what they should we are a rocket upward
the farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for ethanol not even including the year around which is already done it will be a giant package get ready at the same time i was able to save the small refineries from certain closing great for all
perhaps never in the history of our country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than james comey in the just released inspector report he should be ashamed of himself

general motors which was once the giant of detroit is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there they moved major plants to china before i came into office this was done despite the saving help given them by the usa now they should start moving back to america again
the disastrous ig report on james comey shows in the strongest of terms how unfairly i and tens of millions of great people who support me were treated our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool we should be given our stolen time back
the fact that james comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable attorney general bill barr is so many people and experts that i have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course comey got lucky
bryan dean wright former cia officerdem we had a coup we have to take comey and others to task makes no sense not to prosecute him comey got a book deal i fear for my country he tried to kneecap our duly elected president and there are no foxfs

the euro is dropping against the dollar giving them a big export and manufacturing advantageand the fed does nothing our dollar is now the strongest in history sounds good it except to those manufacturers that make product for sale outside the us
we have a tariff problem we are reigning in bad andor unfair players we have a fed problem they have a clue
if the fed would cut we would have one of the biggest stock market increases in a long time badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small tariffs instead of themselves for bad managementand who can really blame them for doing that excuses
the united states of america was not involved in the catastrophic accident during final launch preparations for the safir slv launch at semnan launch site one in iran i wish iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at site
thanks repdougcollins
of the most disgraceful examples of an abuse of power by a government you read this is a systematic effort to go after candidate trump president electtrump and president trumpyou could virtually call this an attempted coup
fallout from igs scathing comey reportpictwittercomnrpebkpbww
this should never happen to another president

the great state of north carolina has early voting for a very important congressional ninth race please vote early now or on election day september for dan bishop a great guy his opponent wants open borders sanctuary cities is weak on crime military vets
just arrived at camp david
could have charged comey with theft of government documents of the criminal code because the ig found these were not his personal documents these were government greggjarrett claim that these were just his own personal recollections would not
pass the laugh test and the inspector general just knocked that byronyork loudobbs
ig found that james comey leaked classified documents to his attorneys which can be is a violation of the espionage act this is consistent with all the lies that comey has been spreading greggjarrett byronyork loudobbs
while madeleine westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement she is a very good person and i think there would ever be reason to use it she called me yesterday to apologize had a bad night i fully understood and forgave her i love tiffany doing great
yes i am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements disgusting and foul mouthed omarosa is one i gave her every break despite the fact that she was despised by everyone and she went for some cheap money from a book numerous others also
i was right about comey crooked cop
make america great again which is happening and then keep america great
looking like our great south carolina could get hit much harder than first thought georgia and north carolina also moving around and very hard to predict except that it is one of the biggest and strongest and really wide that we have seen in decades be safe
has anyone noticed that the top shows on foxnews and cable ratings are those that are fair or great to your favorite president me congratulations to seanhannity for being the number one show on cable television
just watched congresswoman debbie dingell and many other democrats wanting to give up on our very successful trade battle with china which has had its worst economic year in memory and getting worse we are taking in billions will be big for farmers and all
being scolded by failed former officials like james clapper on my condolences to iran on their failed rocket launch sadly for the united states guys like him comey and the even dumber john brennan have a clue they really set our country back
but now we are moving forward like never before we are winning again and we are respected again
vindication belongs to the president for firing james comey it was clearly the right thing to do you want an fbi director with jim jason riley wall street journal
just briefed by attorney general barr about the shootings in texas fbi and law enforcement is fully engaged more to follow
peter morici economist tariffs will not impact american consumers that much because the chinese currency has gone down which gives our importers a discount importers can find suppliers outside of china absolutely worth it we want to be servants to the chinese this
is about american freedom redirect the supply chain there is no reason to buy everything from china
comey has been rebuked at the highest level with much more to come an ig report get any stronger calling him dangerous insubordinate thank goodness that donald trump was elected because if he elected these people would still be in power two more
reports are coming comey very vulnerable but where is the supreme court where is justice roberts if you lie to a court you should be held in contempt so if you abused the fisa you must be held accountable i hope justice roberts will take jason chaffetz fox
and mccabe and more are dirty joe digenova
i have not forgotten that when it was announced that i was going to do the apprentice and when it then became a big hit helping failed lineup greatly debramessing came up to me at an upfront profusely thanked me even calling me how times have changed
in addition to florida south carolina north carolina georgia and alabama will most likely be hit much harder than anticipated looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever already category be careful god bless everyone
great job by texas law enforcement and first responders in handling the terrible shooting tragedy yesterday thank you also to the fbi gregabbotttx and all others a very tough and sad situation
pray for the people in the bahamas being hit like never before category almost mph winds
hold that legislative prayer is government speech not open to attack via those third circuit court of appeals why this next election is so important the soul of america they want to take religion out of american lives thank god for judges like
this judge thomas ambro majotity opinion and thank god for a president like donald j trump who will appoint judges like this he will soon have appointed new federal judges not even including two great new supreme court robertjeffress loudobbs
you put everything together the pro growth tax regulation cuts help to retrain workers the tariffs which encourage manufacturers to come back to america along with president trumps tough approach on immigration strong stance on illegals promoting merit based it
adds up to the most ambitious proworker policy agenda this country has ever seen the president promised jobs jobs jobs and that is exactly what he is stevehiltonx nextrevfnc foxnews
since my election many trillions of dollars of worth has been created for our country and the stock market is up over if you followed the advice of the failing new york times columnist paul krugman be doing very poorly be angry and hurt he never got it
just watched aflcio president richard trumka on foxnews and thought to myself how different he is on tv than he is when he is with me at the white house likes what we are doing until the cameras go on we got robbed on trade and everything else while his dems just sat back
and watched nafta is the worst trade deal ever made terrible for labor and richard let it stand no wonder unions are losing so much the workers will vote for me in lowest unemployment most jobs ever and should stop paying exorbitant dues not worth it
are liars and in my opinion loudobbs talking about comey and his dwindling group of friends
last three years of trump policy have finally brought real hope and real change unemployment this year hit a year low with president trump seen the lowest ever african american and hispanic unemployment the booming trump economy has pushed up workers wages
average hourly wages growth has far outpaced what we saw with president obama across all industries from mining and construction to leisure hospitality with president trump we see income growth in states like iowa ohio pennsylvania wisconsin nevada florida
swing states that went to trump in because he promised not to forget about them like the establishment had done for decades and their trust in president trump paid off as they saw their incomes riseand the lowest paid workers who have gained the most with
trump economics with president trump tariffs are bringing companies back to the usa like he said they would stevehiltonx
the amazon washington post did a story that i brought racist attacks against the no they brought racist attacks against our nation all i do is call them out for the horrible things they have said the democrats have become the party of the squad
the lamestream media has gone totally crazy they write whatever they want seldom have sources even though they say they do never do anymore and are only looking for the they take good news and make it bad they are now beyond fake they are corrupt
the good news is that we are winning our real opponent is not the democrats or the dwindling number of republicans that lost their way and got left behind our primary opponent is the fake news media in the history of our country they have never been so bad
such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter jonkarl of abcworldnews i suggested yesterday at fema that along with florida georgia south carolina and north carolina even alabama could possibly come into play which was true they made a big deal about this
when in fact under certain original scenarios it was in fact correct that alabama could have received some always good to be prepared but the fake news is only interested in demeaning and belittling play my whole sentence or statement bad people
will allow more american ethanol to enter the country without tariffs a decision that brazilian mills are celebrating the seemingly counterintuitive reaction stems from the tone of ongoing negotiations between the south american nation and the us for a
trade business chuckgrassley joniernst senatorfischer bensasse making great progress for our farmers approved year round big additional list to be submitted approved within two weeks will be even better for ethanol and we save our small refineries
we are doing very well in our negotiations with china while i am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of months plus is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a longshot
and then think what happens to china when i win deal would get much tougher in the meantime supply chain will crumble and businesses jobs and money will be gone
for all of the out there many who have been in other administrations and to the by china that want me to get together with the eu and others to go after china trade practices remember the eu all treat us very unfairly on trade also will change
germany and so many other countries have negative interest rates get paid for loaning and our federal reserve fails to act remember these are also our weak currency competitors
based on the ig report the whole witch hunt against me and my administration was a giant and illegal scam the house of representatives should now get back to work on drug prices healthcare infrastructure and all else the mueller report showed no collusion no obstruction

the us may be getting a little bit lucky with respect to hurricane dorian but please let down your guard as it heads up the coast lots of very bad and unpredictable things can happen on the other hand the bahamas have been devastated we are sending crews to help
at the request of senator thom tillis i am getting the north carolina emergency declaration completed and signed tonight hope you need it
the truth is that we have a nation that is disgusted with the fbi we have a crisis of confidence in the number one law enforcement agency in this country thanks comey loudobbs a alandersh
am so tired of hearing the rationalization of the left in the country because they hate donald trump inexplicably and without foundation they choose to hate america the democrats have truly become the party of loudobbs
declassify is so important because if this were a democrat president or a democrat candidate that was spied on the way president trump was spied on this would be a scandal that would make watergate look like nothing illegal spying

chinese are very adept at not accepting anything got to be very tough and what trump is doing in interest to correct and i think end up with a solution dramatically better than we have today frankly i think the impact of what
trump is doing to china is not lost on the rest of the world europe has had among the most protectionist policies forever sitting there and saying gee are we next maybe you are got to change the rules the us defend the world and pay for it
we have a system where we run our entire economy for the benefit of other countries which have long charged us big tariffs keep ducking the reality the us has been subject to tariff terrorism for years but a real deal can be sam zell joesquawk

this was the originally projected path of the hurricane in its early stages as you can see almost all models predicted it to go through florida also hitting georgia and alabama i accept the fake news
nothing is more important than going back getting to the bottom of the origins of the investigation we had an administration using spying apparatus to spy on a political opponent at the height of a presidential election those are all known undisputed
facts and that should terrify every american regardless of their political stripe the idea that all of that information already been revealed shows how dastardly these people are and how terrified they are about going to happen when that
information does come charlie hurt washington times loudobbs

in the early days of the hurricane when it was predicted that dorian would go through miami or west palm beach even before it reached the bahamas certain models strongly suggested that alabama georgia would be hit as it made its way through florida to the gulf
instead it turned north and went up the coast where it continues now in the one model through florida the great state of alabama would have been hit or grazed in the path it took no read my full fema statement what i said was accurate all fake news in order to demean
bad debra the mess messing is in hot water she wants to create a of trump supporters is being accused of mccarthyism is also being accused of being a racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness if roseanne barr
said what she did even being on a much higher rated show she would have been thrown off television will fake news nbc allow a mccarthy style racist to continue abc fired roseanne watch the double standard
alabama was going to be hit or grazed and then hurricane dorian took a different path up along the east coast the fake news knows this very well why the fake news
really good jobs numbers
after almost years in my administration jason greenblatt will be leaving to pursue work in the private sector jason has been a loyal and great friend and fantastic lawyer
his dedication to israel and to seeking peace between israel and the palestinians be forgotten he will be missed thank you jason
just as i said alabama was originally projected to be hit the fake news denies
just talked to governor roy cooper of north carolina as hurricane dorian ominously comes up the east coast we are monitoring it at the whitehouse ready to assist via our great team over at fema who are already on site we are with you all the way north carolina be safe
just spoke to governor henrymcmaster of south carolina regarding hurricane dorian i informed henry that we are monitoring south carolina and stand by ready to assist be safe everyone we are totally with you
just got off the phone with governor brian kemp govkemp of georgia happy to hear that things are looking good for everyone i stand by ready to assist along with our great team at fema with you all the way
great job done by govrondesantis senrickscott senator marcorubio and all of the those from florida that were so brilliantly involved including fema uscg law enforcement and first responders thank you all
think president trump is set in his ways because he see any weakening i mean look at the joblessness report today what surprised at is how strong the consumer is i think the chinese need it a deal more than we do statistical i just think
that our economy is very strong if the fed would lower rates to where the bond market says they should be then i really worry about a jimcramer joesquawk
the immigration law christopher hajec says supreme court has to look st whether daca is lawful what they are looking at now is whether recision of daca is lawful must consider lawfulness of daca itself looks very odd that president trump
have the discretion to end the program that president obama began in his discretion that program was unlawful to begin with i think very unlikely that the scotus is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program daca is
president obama never had the legal right to sign daca and he indicated so at the time of signing but in any event how can he have the right to sign and i have the right to totally illegal document which would actually give the president new powers
daca will be going before the supreme court it is a document that even president obama feel he had the legal right to sign he signed it anyway rest assured that if the sc does what all say it must based on the law a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all
i agree with jimcramer the fed should lower rates they were way too early to raise and way too late to cut and big dose quantitative tightening exactly help either where did i find this guy jerome oh well you win them all
congratulations to edhenry and his sister on a great success what a wonderful thing to do

larry kudlow on varneyco now
the fake news media was fixated on the fact that i properly said at the beginnings of hurricane dorian that in addition to florida other states alabama may also be grazed or hit they went crazy hoping against hope that i made a mistake which i check out maps
this nonsense has never happened to another president four days of corrupt reporting still without an apology but there are many things that the fake news media has not apologized to me for like the witch hunt or spygate the lamestream media and their democrat
partner should start playing it straight it would be so much better for our country
great job by fema law enforcement first responders us coast guard and all keep going we all appreciate what you are doing
the economy is great the only thing adding to is the fake news

the uscg fema and all others along with other countries that have been helping have been asked to move people in the badly hit sections of the bahamas to other sections of the bahamas

promises made promises
china just enacted a major stimulus plan with all the tariffs they are paying to the usa billions and billions of dollars they need it in the meantime our federal reserve sits back and does nothing
thank you to bahamian prime minister hubert minnis for your very gracious and kind words in saying that without the help of the united states and me their would have been many more casualties i give all credit to fema the us coast guard the brave people of the bahamas

the failing new york times stated in an article written by obama flunky peter baker who lovingly wrote obama after the president forecast the storm to include this is not true i said very early on that it may even hit alabama a big difference
fake news i would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story but the lamestream media just let it alone they always have to have the last word even though they know they are defrauding deceiving the public the public knows that the media is corrupt
unbeknownst to almost everyone the major taliban leaders and separately the president of afghanistan were going to secretly meet with me at camp david on sunday they were coming to the united states tonight unfortunately in order to build false leverage they admitted to
an attack in kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers and other people i immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations what kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position they they
only made it worse if they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks and would even kill innocent people then they probably have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway how many more decades are they willing to fight

when all of the people pushing so hard for criminal justice reform were unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help i got it done with a group of senators others who would never have gone for it obama come close
a man named and many others were profusely grateful at that time i signed it into law no one else did republicans deserve much credit but now that it is passed people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise guys like boring
musician johnlegend and his filthy mouthed wife are talking now about how great it is but i see them around when we needed help getting it passed lesterholtnbc even bring up the subject of president trump or the republicans when talking about
the importance or passage of criminal justice reform they only talk about the minor players or people that had nothing to do with itand the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed all they talk about now is impeaching president trump
north carolina vote for dan bishop tomorrow we need him badly in washington his opponent is a far left sanctuary cities supporter
when the former governor of the great state of south carolina marksanford was reported missing only to then say he was away hiking on the appalachian trail then was found in argentina with his flaming dancer friend it sounded like his political career was over it was
but then he ran for congress and won only to lose his reelect after i tweeted my endorsement on election day for his opponent but now take heart he is back and running for president of the united states the three stooges all badly failed candidates will give it a go
house republicans should allow chairs of committees to remain for longer than years it forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving the dems have unlimited terms while that has its own problems it is a better way to go fewer people in the end will leave
approval rating in the republican party a record thank you
great news that an activist investor is now involved with att as the owner of very low ratings cnn perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the fake news emanating from its noncredible also i hear that because of its bad ratings it is losing a fortune
but most importantly cnn is bad for the usa their international division spews bad information fake news all over the globe this is why foreign leaders are always asking me does the media hate the us sooo it is a fraudulent shame all comes from the top
as bad as cnn is comcast msnbc is worse their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility i believe their stories about me are not negative but actually negative they are incapable of saying anything positive despite all of the great things
that this administration has done they talk about the great economy the big tax and regulation cuts the rebuilding of the military at our va our vets judges and supreme court justices the border wall going up lowest crime numbers a and so much more
i know nothing about an air force plane landing at an airport which i do not own and have nothing to do with near turnberry resort which i do own in scotland and filling up with fuel with the crew staying overnight at turnberry they have good taste nothing to do with me
i had nothing to do with the decision of our great vp mike pence to stay overnight at one of the trump owned resorts in doonbeg ireland family has lived in doonbeg for many years and he thought that during his very busy european visit he would stop and see his family
the trump administration has achieved more in the first years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our country we get zero media credit for what we have done and are doing but the people know and all that is important
a lot of fake news is being reported that i overruled the vp and various advisers on a potential camp david meeting with the taliban this story is false i always think it is good to meet and talk but in this case i decided not to the dishonest media likes to create
the look of turmoil in the white house of which there is none i view much of the media as simply an arm of the democrat party they are corrupt and they are extremely upset at how well our country is doing under my leadership including
the economy where there is no recession much to the regret of the lamestream media they are working overtime to help the democrats win in but that will never happen americans are too smart
we have been serving as policemen in afghanistan and that was not meant to be the job of our great soldiers the finest on earth over the last four days we have been hitting our enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years

north carolina vote for dan bishop today we need him badly in washington
abcwashington post poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the election when my lawyers protested they took a point down and brought it to almost even by election day it was a fake poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets sad
one of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the fake and corrupt news media is the phony polling information they put out many of these polls are fixed or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad internal polling looks great the best ever
vote today for dan bishop will be great for north carolina and our country
i informed john bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the white house i disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions as did others in the administration and therefore

the federal reserve should get our interest rates down to zero or less and we should then start to refinance our debt interest cost could be brought way down while at the same time substantially lengthening the term we have the great currency power and balance sheet
the usa should always be paying the the lowest rate no inflation it is only the of jay powell and the federal reserve that allow us to do what other countries are already doing a once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of
in a hypothetical poll done by one of the worst pollsters of them all the amazon washington postabc which predicted i would lose to crooked hillary by points how did that work out sleepy joe pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the general election
this is a phony suppression poll meant to build up their democrat partners i even started campaigning yet and am constantly fighting fake news like russia russia russia look at north carolina last night dan bishop down big in the polls wins easier than

i had an excellent telephone conversation with manuel obrador president of mexico talking about southern border security and various other things of mutual interest for the people of our respective countries
the southern border is becoming very strong despite the obstruction by democrats not agreeing to do anything on loopholes or asylum
the wall is going up very fast despite total obstruction by democrats in congress and
european central bank acting quickly cuts rates basis points they are trying and succeeding in depreciating the euro against the very strong dollar hurting us exports and the fed sits and sits and sits they get paid to borrow money while we are paying interest
it is expected that china will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products
some really big court wins on the border lately

illegal immigration costs the usa over billion dollars a year there is no reason for this and things are being set in motion to have this number come way down democrats could end loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier and faster but it will all happen anyway
very stupidly negotiated trade deals and illegal immigration are a tremendous cost and burden to our country they are both coming along very well and someday in the not too distant future america will see a very positive change remember america first

believe the washingtonpost wrote a positive front page story issue has parties pointing to trump gop goes all in while democrats clash over ideology tactics mr president we are with you the entire way republicans havecoalesced around
then on top of it all kathleen parker of all people wrote case you were wondering trump won the true but what is going on at the washingtonpost not fake news
based on the attack on saudi arabia which may have an impact on oil prices i have authorized the release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve if needed in a tobedetermined amount
sufficient to keep the markets wellsupplied i have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in texas and various other states
saudi arabia oil supply was attacked there is reason to believe that we know the culprit are locked and loaded depending on verification but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack and under what terms we would proceed
plenty of oil
here we go again with general motors and the united auto workers get together and make a deal
the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran that is an incorrect statement as usual
cannot have what happened to this president happen joe digenova is time for justice to come barreling loudobbs can you imagine that with everything going on in this world the witch hunt though on a respirator is still whimpering along a disgrace
house judiciary has given up on the mueller report sadly for them after two years and spent zero collusion zero obstruction so they say ok lets look at everything else and all of the deals that has done over his lifetime but it
work that way i have a better idea look at the obama book deal or the ridiculous netflix deal then look at all the deals made by the dems in congress the slush and lastly the ig reports take a look at them those investigations would be over fast
the nytimes week the senate passed a milestone in confirming the federal judge of mr administration to a lifetime appointment far outstripping barack pace and fulfilling pledges by mr trump and mr to remake the federal judiciary
conservative judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to said lindsey graham republican of south carolina who leads the judiciary committee and who has been speeding through trump the entire court system is changing at a record pace
because we have done so well with energy over the last few years thank you mr president we are a net energy exporter now the number one energy producer in the world we need middle eastern oil gas in fact have very few tankers there but will help our allies
producer prices in china shrank most in years due to big devaluation of their currency coupled with monetary stimulus federal reserve not watching will fed ever get into the game dollar strongest ever really bad for exports no inflationhighest interest rates
the united states because of the federal reserve is paying a much higher interest rate than other competing countries they believe how lucky they are that jay powell the fed have a clue and now on top of it all the oil hit big interest rate drop stimulus
new york times walks back report on kavanaugh assault foxandfriends the one who is actually being assaulted is justice kavanaugh assaulted by lies and fake news this is all about the lamestream media working with their partner the dems
happening to justice kavanaugh is a disgrace this guy is not a good man he is a great man he has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him a dan bongino foxandfriends
just out accuser recall foxandfriends do you believe what these horrible people will do or say they are looking to destroy and influence his opinions but played the game badly they should be sued
remember when iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their when in fact it was nowhere close they stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on saudi arabia see
would rather talk about gun control than get something governor john sununu foxnews billhemmer the big questions are will they the and is this just a ploy to take your guns away i hope not on both counts but be able to figure it out
they failed on the mueller report they failed on robert testimony they failed on everything else so now the democrats are trying to build a case that i enrich myself by being president good idea except i will and have always expected to lose billions of dollars
for the privilege of being your president and doing the best job that has been done in many decades i am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening or filling up a gas tank at an airport i do not own these radical left democrats are crazy obama netflix
in a short while i will be presenting the new york yankees marianorivera the greatest relief pitcher closer of all time with the presidential medal of freedom in the east room of the whitehouse
congratulations
many stories are wrong almost all of the stories the new york times has done are inaccurate and greggutfeld the new york times should close its doors and throw away the keys the women mentioned in the kavanaugh story said she even remember the event
i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story and while at it the russian witch hunt hoax which is just as phony taken the old grey lady and broken her down destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation
she can never recover and will never return to greatness under current management the times is dead long live the new york times
keep america
we are all united by the same love of country the same devotion to family and the same profound faith that america is blessed by the eternal grace of almighty god bound by these convictions we will campaign for every vote we will win the great state of new mexico in
the new york times is at its lowest point in its long and storied history not only is it losing a lot of money but it is a journalistic disaster being laughed at even in the most liberal of enclaves it has become a very sad joke all all over the world witch hunt hurt them

such a beautiful opening statement by corey lewandowski thank you corey clewandowski

i am pleased to announce that i will name robert c currently serving as the very successful special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the state department as our new national security advisor i have worked long hard with robert he will do a great job
the trump administration is revoking federal waiver on emissions in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer while at the same time making the cars substantially safer this will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety
advantage and also due to the fact that older highly polluting cars will be replaced by new extremely environmentally friendly cars there will be very little difference in emissions between the california standard and the new us standard but the cars will be
far safer and much less expensive many more cars will be produced under the new and uniform standard meaning significantly more jobs jobs jobs automakers should seize this opportunity because without this alternative to california you will be out of business
jay powell and the federal reserve fail again no no sense no vision a terrible communicator

another fake news story out there it never ends virtually anytime i speak on the phone to a foreign leader i understand that there may be many people listening from various us agencies not to mention those from the other country itself no problem
knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that i would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially call i would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the usa
presidential harassment

the radical left democrats and their fake news media partners headed up again by little adam schiff and batting zero for against me are at it again they think i may have had a conversation with a certain foreign leader based on a whistleblowers
statement strange that with so many other people hearing or knowing of the perfectly fine and respectful conversation that they would not have also come forward do you know the reason why they did not because there was nothing said wrong it was pitch perfect

thank you working

i want to express my gratitude to magnificent flotus for exquisite evening where we celebrated more than a century of loyal and devoted friendship betweenboth of our nations are blessed by uncommon courage unfailing commitment and unyielding
the fake news media and their partner the democrat party want to stay as far away as possible from the joe biden demand that the ukrainian government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son or they get a very large amount of us money so they fabricate a
story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation i had with the new president of the ukraine nothing was said that was in any way wrong but demand on the other hand was a complete and total disaster the fake news knows this but want to report
this is the real and only
now that the democrats and the fake news media have gone on every other of their witch hunt schemes they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others call it the ukraine witch hunt while at the same time trying to protect sleepy joe biden will fail again


some of the best economic numbers our country has ever experienced are happening right now this is despite a crooked and demented deep state and a probably illegal democratfake news media partnership the likes of which the world has never seen make america great again



pretend ukraine scandal is an another malicious seditious effort to protect the obamaclinton gang criminal classified leaks and spying targeting trump tomfitton
appears that an american spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president the complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on conversation
with a foreign leader was this person officially asked to listen to the conversation or was he or she secretly listening greggjarrett
trying to turn what was a biden scandal into a trump peterschweizer the problem is did nothing wrong
foreign minister disputes reports of any pressure from trump this conversation was long friendly and it touched on many nbcnews correct if your looking for something done wrong just look at the tape of sleepy joe he is being protected by the media
the lamestream media had a very bad week they pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially the failing new york times which has lost more money over the last years than any paper in history and the amazon washington post they are the enemy of the people
the fake news media nowadays not only check for the accuracy of the facts they knowingly make up the facts they even make up sources in order to protect their partners the democrats it is so wrong but they even care anymore they have gone totally crazy
someone gets nominated overwhelmingly and then wins the election as he did then he gets to set the national agenda the press is just outrages this nytimes story is the most irresponsible thing ever edrollins loudobbs i agree they also lose too much

real story involves hunter biden going around the world and collecting large payments from foreign governments and foreign peter schweizer laura ingraham hunter made a fortune in ukraine and in china he knew nothing about energy or anything else
across the world and see either very low interest rates or negative rates the president wants to be competitive with these other countries on this but i think fire jay powell even if i we should always be paying less interest than others
are trying to destroy and influence justice kavanaugh a very good lindseygrahamsc correct and they should be fully exposed for what they are
nytimes is trying to make someone justice kavanaugh into an evil person when they have the information to back it up it is a false mzhemingway mediabuzzfnc zero people were fired at the times why
justice kavanaugh should sue the failing new york times for all they are worth

now the fake news media says i the ukrainian president at least times during my telephone call with this supposedly comes from a socalled who they say even have a first hand account of what was said more democratcrooked media con
breaking news the ukrainian government just said they pressured at all during the call sleepy joe biden on the other hand forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his company by threat of not giving big dollars to ukraine the real story
just leaving the great state of ohio for new york and a few big days at the united nations your country will be well represented

very thing that they are accusing president trump of doing which i do was actually done by joe biden continues to be a double repdevinnunes foxandfriends these people are stone cold crooked also who is this socalled who
know the correct facts is he on our side where does he come from is this all about schiff the democrats again after years of being wrong
this is the real corruption that the fake news media refuses to even
thank you working
approval rating in the republican party thank you
foxnews bombshell information reports that the socalled whistleblower did not have firsthand knowledge of that phone conversation with wow harrisfaulkner it is all a democratadam schiff scam doing this for years now and found nothing

i am currently at the united nations representing our country but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with president zelensky of ukraine
you will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call no pressure and unlike joe biden and his son no quid pro quo this is nothing more than a continuation of the greatest and most destructive witch hunt of all time
thank
the democrats are so focused on hurting the republican party and the president that they are unable to get anything done because of it including legislation on gun safety lowering of prescription drug prices infrastructure etc so bad for our country
such an important day at the united nations so much work and so much success and the democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news witch hunt garbage so bad for our country
pelosi nadler schiff and of course maxine waters can you believe this
they never even saw the transcript of the call a total witch hunt
presidential harassment

secretary of state pompeo recieved permission from ukraine government to release the transcript of the telephone call i had with their president they know either what the big deal is a total witch hunt scam by the democrats

there has been no president in the history of our country who has been treated so badly as i have the democrats are frozen with hatred and fear they get nothing done this should never be allowed to happen to another president witch hunt
democrats have been talking about impeaching donald trump since before he was stevedoocy foxandfriends and for no reason other than the great success we are having with the economy the military vets tax and regulation cuts healthcare and so much more
will the democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the ukrainian president they should a perfect call got them by surprise

see a direct quid pro quo in bretbaier
pictwittercomenifgzhudc
president trump specifically mention the explicit quid pro quo you investigate going to withhold military aid to pamela brown

wow lead attorney donated to freebeacon
i have informed gopleader kevin mccarthy and all republicans in the house that i fully support transparency on socalled whistleblower information but also insist on transparency from joe biden and his son hunter on the millions of dollars that have been quickly and easily
taken out of ukraine and china additionally i demand transparency from democrats that went to ukraine and attempted to force the new president to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat

the greatest scam in the history of american politics
there a case for impeachment absolutely not there is no high crime or misdemeanor no crime no extortion no robert ray foxnews
a whistleblower with second hand information another fake news story see what was said on the very nice no pressure call another witch hunt
adam schiff has zero credibility another fantasy to hurt the republican party
adam schiff who has worked unsuccessfully for years to hurt the republican party and president has just said that the whistleblower even though he or she only had second hand information how can that be with zero info and a known bias democrat scam
congratulations to my friend senshelby our powerful appropriations chairman for his hard work on many strong bills that continue to rebuild our military invest in border security and many other priorities good work and keep fighting you are winning
no one has done more behind the scenes for strong border security than sencapito her bill passed committee today with for the border wall west virginia is a great state and shelley gets it done keep it up
the president of ukraine said that he was not pressured by me to do anything wrong have better testimony than that as vp biden had his son on the other hand take out millions of dollars by strong arming the ukrainian president also looted millions from china bad

to show you how dishonest the lamestream media is i used the word not liddle in discribing corrupt congressman adam schiff low ratings cnn purposely took the hyphen out and said i spelled the word little wrong a small but never ending situation with cnn
obama loving wrote obama book peter baker of the failing new york times married to an even bigger trump hater than himself should not even be allowed to write about me every story is a made up disaster with sources and leakers that even exist i had a simple and very
nice call with with the new president of ukraine it could not have been better or more honorable and the fake news media and democrats working as a team have fraudulently made it look bad it bad it was very legal and very good a continuing witch hunt
rep adam schiff fraudulently read to congress with millions of people watching a version of my conversation with the president of ukraine that exist he was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call but he completely changed the words to make it
sound horrible and me sound guilty he was desperate and he got caught adam schiff therefore lied to congress and attempted to defraud the american public he has been doing this for two years i am calling for him to immediately resign from congress based on this fraud
pictwittercomlnnygmlekj
iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet i said of course no
was a perfect conversation with ukraine
rep adam schiff totally made up my conversation with ukraine president and read it to congress and millions he must resign and be investigated he has been doing this for two years he is a sick man
the democrats are now to be known as the do nothing party
sounding more and more like the socalled whistleblower a whistleblower at all in addition all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else a leaker or spy feeding it to him or her a partisan operative
if that perfect phone call with the president of ukraine considered appropriate then no future president can ever again speak to another foreign leader
i am draining the
can you imagine if these do nothing democrat savages people like nadler schiff aoc plus and many more had a republican party who would have done to obama what the do nothings are doing to me oh well maybe next time
presidential harassment

they are trying to stop me because i am fighting for
how do you impeach a president who has created the greatest economy in the history of our country entirely rebuilt our military into the most powerful it has ever been cut record taxes regulations fixed the va gotten choice for our vets after years so much more
the conversation with the new and very good ukraine president who told the fake news at the united nations that he was not pressured by me in any way shape or form should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent witch hunt others ended in ashes
the complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new president of ukraine the socalled knew practically nothing in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic wrong just like adam schiff
fraudulently and illegally inserted his made up twisted words into my call with the ukrainian president to make it look like i did something very wrong he then boldly read those words to congress and millions of people defaming libeling me he must resign from congress
it is disgraceful what the do nothing democrats are doing the impeachment scam but it is also disgraceful what they are not doing namely the usmca vote prescription drug price reduction gun safety infrastructure and much more
the only people that like my conversation with the new ukrainian president are those that heard rep adam schiff read a made up and totally fraudulent statement to the house and public words that i did not say but that he fabricated admitted to this fabrication sick

like every american i deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the socalled represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way then schiff made up what i actually said by lying to congress
his lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great chamber he wrote down and read terrible things then said it was from the mouth of the president of the united states i want schiff questioned at the highest level for fraud treason
in addition i want to meet not only my accuser who presented second third hand information but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the was this person spying on the us president big consequences

department has stepped up hillary clinton email foxandfriends you mean the emails that she has deleted and acid washed so they can never be found even though she said that all pertained only to her wedding and her yoga
pelosi and the democrats put down the impeachment match they know they beat him in against hillary clinton and increasingly aware of the fact that they win against him in and impeachment is the only tool they have to get
rid of donald j trump and the democrats care if they burn down and destroy this nation in the process i have never seen the evangelical christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this president from office overturn the
election and negate the votes of millions of evangelicals in the process they know the only impeachable offense that president trump has committed was beating hillary clinton in the unpardonable sin for which the democrats will never forgive him
if the democrats are successful in removing the president from office which they will never be it will cause a civil war like fracture in this nation from which our country will never pastor robert jeffress foxnews

rep adam schiff illegally made up a fake terrible statement pretended it to be mine as the most important part of my call to the ukrainian president and read it aloud to congress and the american people it bore no relationship to what i said on the call arrest for treason
many years the united states is finally waking up to plans and ambitions to pass us as the dominant economic military superpower in the century happening now is that the us is finally responding thank you president trump this is taking

congratulations to president xi and the chinese people on the anniversary of the republic of china

congratulatory phone call with the ukrainian president was perfect unless you heard adam fraudulently made up version of the call this is just another fake news media together with their partner the democrat party hoax
so if the socalled has all second hand information and almost everything he has said about my call with the ukrainian president is wrong much to the embarrassment of pelosi schiff why we entitled to interview learn everything about
the whistleblower and also the person who gave all of the false information to him this is simply about a phone conversation that could not have been nicer warmer or better no pressure at all as confirmed by ukrainian pres it is just another democrat hoax
as i predicted jay powell and the federal reserve have allowed the dollar to get so strong especially relative to all other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected fed rate too high they are their own worst enemies they have a clue pathetic
why congressman adam schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the president of the united states this should never be allowed

congressman adam schiff should resign for the crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the president of ukraine it was perfect fraudulently fabricating a statement of the president of the united states and reading it to congress as though mine he is sick
all the do nothing democrats are focused on is impeaching the president for having a very good conversation with the ukrainian president i knew that many people were listening even have a transcript they have been at this from the day i got elected bad for country
pelosi and the democrats met the standards of impeachment they have to be very careful jeanne zaino foxnews
now the press is trying to sell the fact that i wanted a moat stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our southern border i may be tough on border security but not that tough the press has gone crazy fake news
all of this impeachment nonsense which is going nowhere is driving the stock market and your down but that is exactly what the democrats want to do they are willing to hurt the country with only the election in mind
nancy pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices working on the desperately needed usmca she is incapable of working on either it is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment the do nothing democrats are stuck in mud
democrats are trying to undo the election regardless of
adam schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of secretary of state mike pompeo for a lowlife like schiff who completely fabricated my words and read them to congress as though they were said by me to demean a first in class at west point is sad

shifty
connection to the whistleblower is coming to foxnews these facts and others make it impossible for the ridiculous impeachment to go forward schiff has also committed a crime perhaps treason in making up a horrible statement and reading
it to congress and the american people as though it was the statement of the president of the united states me he did it to fool congress and the public in order to make me look bad he is a sick puppy

often i get angry at the dirty politics of the democrats in congress but this time i am enraged and hope this impeachment charade will backfire on reps pelosi schiff the democrats i have read thoroughly the telephone conversation between trump the president
of ukraine and cannot find any reason to charge the president with high crimes misdemeanors this is just a phony witch hunt perpetuated by democrats to get rid of trump because they cannot beat him in a fair richard ketay

somebody please wake up mitt romney and tell him that my conversation with the ukrainian president was a congenial and very appropriate one and my statement on china pertained to corruption not politics if mitt worked this hard on obama he could have won sadly he choked
mitt romney never knew how to win he is a pompous who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his senate run i gave it to him and when he begged me to be secretary of state i give it to him he is so bad for
this is the real story greggjarrettpictwittercomawrtyshjql
schiff is a fraud

not only are the do nothing democrats interfering in the election but they are continuing to interfere in the election they must be stopped
so crooked hillary clinton can delete and acid wash emails after getting a subpoena from the united states congress but i make one totally appropriate telephone call to the president of ukraine witch hunt
trump would be negligent if he did not bring this matter biden up if the vp of the us is self enriching engaged in criminal behavior at a minimum corrupt behavior it ought to be looked peter schweizer author marklevinshow
the first socalled second hand information got my phone conversation almost completely wrong so now word is they are going to the bench and another is coming in from the deep state also with second hand info meet with shifty keep them coming

the democrats are lucky that they have any mitt romney types they may be lousy politicians with really bad policies open borders sanctuary cities etc but they stick together
it is incredible to watch and read the fake news and how they pull out all stops to protect sleepy joe biden and his thrown out of the military son hunter who was handed a month plusplus from a ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy
and separately got billion dollars from china despite no experience and for no apparent reason there is no way these can be legitimate transactions as lawyers others have stated as president i have an obligation to look into possible or probable corruption
the biden family was paid off pure and simple the fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable sleepy joe said he never spoke to the ukrainian company and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and hunter
and by the way i would love running against joe biden i just think going to happen sleepy joe get to the starting gate based on all of the money he his family probably joe should hang it up i want him dealing with china u

to report that we are helping the great farmers of the usa to the tune of billion dollars for the last two years paid for out of tariffs paid to the united states by china for targeting the farmer they devalued their currency therefore paying the cost
nancy pelosi knew of all of the many shifty adam schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon congress and the american people in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan lawyer
this makes nervous nancy every bit as guilty as adam schiff for high crimes and misdemeanors and even treason i guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly with them must all be immediately impeached
the united states was supposed to be in syria for days that was many years ago we stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight when i arrived in washington isis was running rampant in the area we quickly defeated of the isis caliphate
including capturing thousands of isis fighters mostly from europe but europe did not want them back they said you keep them usa i said we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in us prisons at tremendous cost they are yours for they
again said thinking as usual that the us is always the on nato on trade on everything the kurds fought with us but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so they have been fighting turkey for decades i held off this fight for
almost years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous endless wars many of them tribal and bring our soldiers home we will fight where it is to our benefit and only fight to win turkey europe syria iran iraq russia and the kurds will now have to
figure the situation out and what they want to do with the captured isis fighters in their they all hate isis have been enemies for years we are miles away and will crush isis again if they come anywhere near us
we just won the big court case on net neutrality rules a great win for the future and speed of the internet will lead to many big things including congratulations to the fcc and its chairman ajit pai
declassified information contradicts the foxandfriends but why are people surprised the whistleblower was very wrong on what was said on my perfect call with the ukrainian president bring in another whistleblower from the bench
much higher under trump than bush foxandfriends and almost everything else is better also except i am driving the deep state and the radical left do nothing democrats crazy
heritage foundation numbers are blockbusters just since donald trump took office median family incomrs are up over in years under president obama they only went up in one third the time president trump has increased incomes times as much and that
even include the almost that the families got from the trump tax stephen moore freedomworks that means to more in disposable yearly income that americans have right now because of president trump
the radical left democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local new york city and state democrat prosecutors to go get president trump a thing like this has never happened to any president before not even close
i was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who even like the usa the two most unhappy countries at this move are russia china because they love seeing us bogged
down watching over a quagmire spending big dollars to do so when i took over our military was totally depleted now it is stronger than ever before the endless and ridiculous wars are ending we will be focused on the big picture knowing we can always go back blast
as i have stated strongly before and just to reiterate if turkey does anything that i in my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits i will totally destroy and obliterate the economy of turkey done before they must with europe and others watch over
the captured isis fighters and families the us has done far more than anyone could have ever expected including the capture of of the isis caliphate it is time now for others in the region some of great wealth to protect their own territory the usa is great
the truth about impeachment stevehiltonx
thank you

are no felonies there are no impeachable offenses the very clear that you need bribery treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors you be impeached for the conduct been alleged in this alandersh dershowitz seanhannity a scam
so many people conveniently forget that turkey is a big trading partner of the united states in fact they make the structural steel frame for our fighter jet they have also been good to deal with helping me to save many lives at idlib province and returning in very
we may be in the process of leaving syria but in no way have we abandoned the kurds who are special people and wonderful fighters likewise our relationship with turkey a nato and trading partner has been very good turkey already has a large kurdish population and fully
understands that while we only had soldiers remaining in that section of syria and they have been removed any unforced or unnecessary fighting by turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency we are helping the kurds financiallyweapons
i would love to send ambassador sondland a really good man and great american to testify but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court where rights have been taken away and true facts are not allowed out for the public
to see importantly ambassador tweet which few report stated believe you are incorrect about president intentions the president has been crystal clear no quid pro of any that says it all
i think that crooked hillary clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from uber left elizabeth warren only one condition the crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how why she deleted emails after getting subpoena

mueller was pursuing the fbi director job when he met with president trump in administration officials foxnews bret baier and jake gibson seanhannity this is true even though mueller denied it
wow just breaking big deal whistleblower had a to democratic washington examiner byronyork in other words was working with someone who was potentially running against me why this reported by the icig a witch hunt scam


the facts have been so incorrect about my conversation with the ukrainian president and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a democrat candidate that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly this is no whistleblower
the lawyer is a big democrat the whistleblower has ties to one of my democrat opponents why does the icig allow this scam to continue
the united states has spent eight trillion dollars fighting and policing in the middle east thousands of our great soldiers have died or been badly wounded millions of people have died on the other side going into the middle east is the worst decision ever made
in the history of our country we went to war under a false now disproven premise weapons of mass destruction there were none now we are slowly carefully bringing our great soldiers military home our focus is on the big picture the usa is greater than ever before
the do nothing democrats are con artists only looking to hurt the republican party and president their total focus is nothing more and nothing less the good news is that we will win
the socalled whistleblower before knowing i was going to release the exact transcript stated that my call with the ukrainian president was frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national this is a very big lie read the transcript
no pressure at all said ukraine very congenial a perfect call the whistleblower and others spoke before seeing the transcript now they must apologize to me and stop this ridiculous impeachment
president obama said that he did not have the right to sign daca that it will never hold up in court he signed it anyway if the supreme court upholds daca it gives the president extraordinary powers far greater than ever thought if they do what is right and do not let
daca stand with all of its negative legal implications the republicans and democrats will have a deal to let them stay in our country in very short order it would actually benefit daca and be done the right way
so why is someone a good or great president if they needed to spy on someone campaign in order to win that work out so well and if they were unable to fill important federal judgeships a record by far handing them all to me to choose will have soon
only percent want the president impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of fake news coverage but pretty high considering the fact that i did nothing wrong it is all just a continuation of the greatest scam and witch hunt in the history of our country
so pathetic to see sleepy joe biden who with his son hunter and to the detriment of the american taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment and i did nothing wrong failing campaign gave him no other choice
sleepy joe bidenpictwittercomoztytimxqq
the hardest thing i have to do as

think a whistleblower at all i think this is an anonymous source for the democratic staff in the house of representatives this is an insult to real whistleblowers actual whistleblowers go on to have their whole lives john kiriakou tuckercarlson
in case the kurds or turkey lose control the united states has already taken the isis militants tied to beheadings in syria known as the beetles out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the us they are the worst of the worst
from the day i announced i was running for president i have never had a good foxnews poll whoever their pollster is they suck but foxnews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days with people like andrew napolitano who wanted to be a supreme
court justice i turned him down been terrible ever since shep smith donnabrazile who gave crooked hillary the debate questions got fired from cnn others foxnews deliver for us anymore it is so different than it used to be oh well president
turkey has been planning to attack the kurds for a long time they have been fighting forever we have no soldiers or military anywhere near the attack area i am trying to end the endless wars talking to both sides some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to
the area and start a new war all over again turkey is a member of nato others say stay out let the kurds fight their own battles even with our financial help i say hit turkey very hard financially with sanctions if they play by the rules i am watching closely
thank you to oann one america news for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting it is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new consistent and powerful voice see you tonight at the big rally in minneapolis
the president of the ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that president trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong he used the strongest language possible that should end this democrat scam but it because the dems media are fixed
why the ig investigating his socalled whistleblower all bad info
big day of negotiations with china they want to make a deal but do i i meet with the vice premier tomorrow at the white house


we defeated of the isis caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area under attack by turkey in syria we did our job perfectly now turkey is attacking the kurds who have been fighting each other for years

good things are happening at china trade talk meeting warmer feelings than in recent past more like the old days i will be meeting with the vice premier today all would like to see something significant happen
i will be in louisiana tonight love it to get republicans to vote for either of our two great republican candidates and force a run off with john bel edwards who has done a really poor job of tax cutting car insurance cost worst in usa is suspect on your amendment
one of the great things about the china deal is the fact that for various reasons we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex congressional approval process when the deal is fully negotiated i sign it myself on behalf of our country fast and clean
will be with our two great senators senjohnkennedy senbillcassidy tonight in louisiana these two hard working really smart men love their country and love their state we will hopefully add a great new republican governor to the beautiful louisiana mix see you tonight

the same people that got us into the middle east quicksand trillion dollars and many thousands of lives and millions of lives when you count the other side are now fighting to keep us there listen to people that got a clue they have proven to be inept
congratulations to the great state of louisiana a big night you will soon have a new and wonderful governor eddierispone your taxes and car insurance payments will go down
the media is not talking about the big republican victory last night in louisiana where a sitting democrat governor was forced into a runoff by not getting big upset now eddierispone who will be a great governor will win
very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the turkish border for a change those that mistakenly got us into the middle east wars are still pushing to fight they have no idea what a bad decision they have made why are they not asking for a declaration of war
do you remember two years ago when iraq was going to fight the kurds in a different part of syria many people wanted us to fight with the kurds against iraq who we just fought for i said no and the kurds left the fight twice now the same thing is happening with turkey
the kurds and turkey have been fighting for many years turkey considers the pkk the worst terrorists of all others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other let them we are monitoring the situation closely endless wars
dealing with lindseygrahamsc and many members of congress including democrats about imposing powerful sanctions on turkey treasury is ready to go additional legislation may be sought there is great consensus on this turkey has asked that it not be done stay tuned
hunter he has totally disappeared now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries media is awol
we have become a far greater economic power than ever before and we are using that power for world peace

my deal with china is that they will immediately start buying very large quantities of our agricultural product not wait until the deal is signed over the next or weeks they have already started likewise financial services and other deal aspects start preparing

the us has the worst of the isis prisoners turkey and the kurds must not let them escape europe should have taken them back after numerous requests they should do it now they will never come to or be allowed in the united states
somebody please explain to chris wallace of fox who will never be his father and my friend mike wallace that the phone conversation i had with the president of ukraine was a congenial good one it was only made up version of that conversation that was bad
killers get more due process than the democrats give to the president of the united marklevinshow
democrats are trashing this president in the process trashing the us constitution frankly the american people need to wake up to the reality that the democrats are so drunk on power that willing to destroy this constitutional grahamledger oann
adam schiff now seem to want the whistleblower to testify no must testify to explain why he got my ukraine conversation sooo wrong not even close did schiff tell him to do that we must determine the identity to determine why this was done to the usa
game was foiled when we caught schiff fraudulently making up my ukraine conversation when i released the exact conversation transcript and when ukrainian president and the foreign minister said there was no pressure very normal talk a total impeachment scam
former democrat senator harry reid just stated that donald trump is very smart much more popular than people think is underestimated and will be hard to beat in the election thank you harry i agree
brian kilmeade over at foxandfriends got it all wrong we are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for years europe had a chance to get their isis prisoners but want the cost the usa they said
kurds may be releasing some to get us involved easily recaptured by turkey or european nations from where many came but they should move quickly big sanctions on turkey coming do people really think we should go to war with nato member turkey never ending wars will end
the same people who got us into the middle east mess are the people who most want to stay there
happy columbus day

of the correction which they knew about full well news pollster braun research misrepresented impeachment poll nypost
great new book resistance at all costs how trump haters are breaking america out by kimberley strassel of the wall street journal kim has treated us fairly and for that i am very appreciative check it out today it is great
his credit the europeans didnt step up to deal with this isis problem a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today now angela merkel of germany is finally stepping up and telling turkey to back off
dont the europeans have a lot of katiepavlich thank you katie i offered isis prisoners to the european countries from where they came and was rejected on numerous occasions they probably figured that the us would bear the tremendous cost as always
after defeating of the isis caliphate i largely moved our troops out of syria let syria and assad protect the kurds and fight turkey for their own land i said to my generals why should we be fighting for syria
and assad to protect the land of our enemy anyone who wants to assist syria in protecting the kurds is good with me whether it is russia china or napoleon bonaparte i hope they all do great we are miles away
some people want the united states to protect the mile away border of syria presided over by bashar alassad our enemy at the same time syria and whoever they chose to help wants naturally to protect the kurds
i would much rather focus on our southern border which abuts and is part of the united states of america and by the way numbers are way down and the wall is being built
statement from president donald j trump regarding actions in northeast
the democrat party has hijacked the house of representatives
it doesnt speak for the full house because the full house hasnt spoken the democrat party is pushing this impeachment this is a democrat party impeachment as i have been saying a silent coup effort
the house gone rogue i want to remind you a little bit about the ring leader in this whole rogue operation against the president of the united states
shifty schiff now seems to think they need the whistleblower who started the whole scam the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcript also the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned
a big scandal at abc news they got caught using really gruesome fake footage of the turks bombing in syria a real disgrace tomorrow they will ask softball questions to sleepy joe son hunter like why did ukraine china pay you millions when you knew nothing payoff

now that we have found out that cnn is a virtual fraud rumor has it that jeff zucker will be resigining momentarily
shifty adam schiff wants to rest his entire case on a whistleblower who he now says testify the reason he testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the presidential telephone call is a fraud totally different from the actual transcribed call
it also brings fraudulent made up call which he read to the united states congress pretending it to be the words of president trump which they were not nancy pelosi is involved in this fraud in that she confirmed his fraudulent words on gma and much more
you would think there is no way that any of the democrat candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become president of the united states now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal absurd impeachment of one of the most successful presidents
is happening to president trump with impeachment is a constitutional grahamledger the likes of which we have never seen before it is adam schiff and nancy pelosi who should be impeached for fraud
approval rating in the republican party thank you just won two congressional seats in north carolina a governors runoff in louisiana which republicans should now win because of impeachment fraud we will easily take back the house add in the senate again win pres

just spoke to president rterdogan of turkey he told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated he very much wants the ceasefire or pause to work likewise the kurds want it and the ultimate solution to happen too bad there
this thinking years ago instead it was always held together with very weak bandaids in an artificial manner there is good will on both sides a really good chance for success the us has secured the oil the isis fighters are double secured by kurds turkey
i have just been notified that some european nations are now willing for the first time to take the isis fighters that came from their nations this is good news but should have been done after we captured them anyway big progress being made

crooked hillary clinton just called the respected environmentalist and green party candidate jill stein a they need a green party more than ever after looking at the democrats disastrous environmental program
president never told me to withhold any money until the ukrainians did anything related to the server the only reason we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over mick mulvaney statement
i thought i was doing something very good for our country by using trump national doral in miami for hosting the leaders it is big grand on hundreds of acres next to miami international airport has tremendous ballrooms meeting rooms and each delegation would have
its own to unit building would set up better than other alternatives i announced that i would be willing to do it at no profit or if legally permissible at zero cost to the usa but as usual the hostile media their democrat partners went crazy

therefore based on both media democrat crazed and irrational hostility we will no longer consider trump national doral miami as the host site for the in we will begin the search for another site including the possibility of camp david immediately thank you
so now crooked hillary is at it again she is calling congresswoman tulsi gabbard russian and jill stein russian as you may have heard i was called a big russia lover also actually i do like russian people i like all people gone crazy

ceasefire is holding up very nicely there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly new areas being resettled with kurds us soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone we have secured the mark esper secretary of defense ending endless wars

this scam going on right now by the democrats against the republican party and me was all about a perfect phone call i had with the ukrainian president already stated no pressure where is the whistleblower or the whistleblower or the all gone
because their socalled story come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call was it a corrupt adam schiff con why the ig see this when do we depose shifty schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this
fiction to congress and the american people i demand his deposition he is a fraud just like the russia hoax was and the ukraine hoax is now when do the do nothing democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our country when do the republicans finally fight back
so interesting that when i announced trump national doral in miami would be used for the hosting of the and then rescinded due to do nothing democratfake news anger very few in media mentioned that no profits would be taken or would be given free if legally permissible
the democrats impeachment is partisan politics dressed up as stevehiltonx foxnews

ambassador to the european union has already testified he said there was no quid pro quo he said the president had told him kilmeade foxandfriends
thought a very revealing poll was done by the new york times by about a point margin those in battleground states polled are against impeaching the president and if nancy pelosi take note of that maybe she is the third rate kilmeade foxandfriends
a majority do not want him impeached and removed from office of the people in these battleground states who voted for president trump want him to continue as president squarely in his stevedoocy a revealing poll you think that
kilmeade want to know about hillary clinton with the dossier i want to know if there was fisa abuse still waiting for that ainsleyearhardt foxandfriends
so some day if a democrat becomes president and the republicans win the house even by a tiny margin they can impeach the president without due process or fairness or any legal rights all republicans must remember what they are witnessing here a lynching but we will win
thank you republicans out of present voted for last night really good

where is the whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the ukrainian president why did the ig allow this to happen who is the socalled informant schiff who was so inaccurate a giant scam

to tim the button on the iphone was far better than the swipe
democrats just announced that they no longer want the whistleblower to testify but everything was about the whistleblower they no longer want the second whistleblower either which they want because the account of my call bore no relationship to the call itself
the entire impeachment scam was based on my perfect ukrainian call and the whistleblowers account of that call which turned out to be false a fraud once i released the actual call their entire case fell apart the democrats must end this scam now witch hunt
my lawyers should sue the democrats and shifty adam schiff for fraud
michael attorney is demanding that charges be immediately dropped after they found that fbi agents manipulated records against him they say that james clapper told a reporter to a kill shot at flynn this has been a complete setup of michael flynn
they exonerated him completely of being an agent of russia recently crooked hillary charged tulsi gabbard jill stein with the same thingsick and yet mr comey still runs to the white house on february and conjures up the obstruction of justice narrative against
the president when flynn had been cleared of everything long before that the doj is withholding a lot of evidence information as are clapper brennan all of the people who participated in the complete setup of michael sidney powell this is a disgrace
thank you foxandfriends hopefully this is just the beginning of a massive story of injustice and treason you will never learn this from the corrupt lamestream media who get pulitzer prizes for reporting the story totally wrong the ones who report it right get only respect

badly failing presidential candidate kamalaharris will not go to a very wonderful largely african american event today because yesterday i recieved a major award at the same event for being able to produce sign into law major criminal justice reform legislation which will
greatly help the african american community and all other communities and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it this and best unemployment numbers ever is more than kamala will ever be able to do for african americans

the fake washington post keeps doing phony stories with zero sources that i am concerned with the impeachment scam i am not because i did nothing wrong it is the other side including schiff and his made up story that are concerned witch hunt continues

know by now that the impeachment inquiry is just another hoax and silent coup to remove the president from jj crovatto worry jj schiff is a leaker corrupt politician who made up what i said on the call in order to hurt the republican party me
is no underlying crime in that ingrahamangle correct and the whistleblower disappeared after i released the transcript of the call where is the whistleblower that is why this is now called the impeachment hoax the do nothing dems are doing nothing
the only crimes in the impeachment hoax were committed by shifty adam schiff when he totally made up my phone conversation with the ukrainian president and read it to congress together with numerous others on side schiff should be impeached and worse
is a big win for america and also for president nypost
the whistleblower just read the transcript everything else is made up garbage by shifty schiff and the never trumpers
the do nothing democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the best economy ever the monumental weekend raid tax cuts the rebuilding of our military etc the impeachment hoax is a disgrace read the transcript
how many more never trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is read the transcript i knew people were listening in on the call why would i say something inappropriate which was fine with me but why so many
supposedly according to the corrupt media the ukraine call never trumper witness was he on the same call that i was be possible please ask him to read the transcript of the call witch hunt

nervous nancy pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the republican party our polls show that it is going to be just the opposite the do nothing dems will lose many seats in they have a death wish led by a corrupt politician adam schiff
republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the impeachment hoax with the do nothing democrats and now are starting to go after the substance even more than the very infair process because just a casual reading of the transcript leads everybody to see that
the call with the ukrainian president was a totally appropriate one as he said this impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the witch hunt hoax which has been going on since before i even got elected rupublicans go with substance and close it out
the greatest economy in american history
does appear it has to do with nancy pelosi retaining her speakership in the next congress she would like that so going to put it to a vote because what her political left really stevedoocy foxandfriends a disgraceful use of impeachment will backfire
a federal judge is allowing the nick sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting washington post which is no longer available at the white house he could now have a good chance of winning go nick

congratulations to the washington nationals on a great season and an incredible world series game was amazing nationals
is the time for republicans to stand together and defend the leader of their party against these smears it would be one thing if there were any indication of an underlying crime but there is notnot in the transcripts and not in the secret witness testimony that
the dems have selectively leaked nor was there any corrupt intent on the part of the president remember the president knew that that call was being heard and documented by many people anyone with intent would be a tad more discreet you think this farce should
never be allowed to roll into a winter showtrial indeed allowing a long drawn out trial in the senate would merely validate and perpetuate the fraud begun in the house the crisis is of the democrats own making and up to republicans to make sure this never happens

the story in the amazon washington post of course picked up by fake news cnn saying trump asked for ag barr to host a news conference clearing him on is totally untrue and just another fake news story with anonymous sources that exist
the lamestream media which is the enemy of the people is working overtime with made up stories in order to drive dissension and distrust
bill barr did not decline my request to talk about ukraine the story was a fake washington post con job with an source that exist just read the transcript the justice department already ruled that the call was good we have freedom of the press
the degenerate washington post made up the story about me asking bill barr to hold a news conference never happened and there were no sources
read the transcript
based on the information released last night about the fake whistleblowers attorney the impeachment hoax should be ended immediately there is no case except against the other side
did hunter biden do for the senjohnkennedy a very good question he and sleepy joe must testify
it was just explained to me that for next weeks fake hearing trial in the house as they interview never trumpers and others i get no lawyer no due process it is a pelosi schiff scam against the republican party and me this witch hunt should not be allowed to proceed
the amazon washington post and three lowlife reporters matt zapotosky josh dawsey and carol leonnig wrote another fake news story without any sources pure fiction about bill barr myself we both deny this story which they knew before they wrote it a garbage newspaper
the radical left dems and lamestream media are just trying to make it hard for republicans and me to win in the new impeachment hoax is already turning against them
stock market up big today a new record enjoy
statement from president donald j

fake news is reporting that i am talking to mark burnett about doing a big show perhaps the apprentice after the presidency which i would assume they mean in years this is not true never had such a conversation even have time to think about it false reporting

corrupt politician adam schiff wants people from the white house to testify in his and disgraceful witch hunt yet he will not allow a white house lawyer nor will he allow any of our requested witnesses this is a first in due process and congressional history
nothing there trying to let the house know that dividing america for no good reason got a lot of things we should be doing like lowering drug costs getting a trade deal with mexico and lindseygrahamsc the do nothing dems have gone crazy
the call to the ukrainian president was perfect read the transcript there was nothing said that was in any way wrong republicans be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect but is not impeachable no it is much stronger than that nothing was done wrong

the lawyer for the whistleblower takes away all credibility from this big impeachment scam it should be ended and the whistleblower his lawyer and corrupt politician schiff should be investigared for fraud
shifty adam schiff will only release doctored transcripts we even seen the documents and are restricted from get this having a lawyer republicans should put out their own transcripts schiff must testify as to why he made up a statement from me and read it to all

where is the whistleblower who gave so much false information must testify along with schiff and others
read the transcript it is perfect
schiff is giving republicans no witnesses no lawyer no due process it is a totally one sided witch hunt this be making the democrats look good such a farce
just like schiff fabricated my phone call he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing
in order to continue being the most transparent president in history i will be releasing sometime this week the transcript of the first and therefore most important phone call i had with the president of ukraine i am sure you will find it tantalizing
schiff and the dems have created this whole thing they reverse engineer it been vowing to impeach for three years why should we listen to them why should we want greggutfeld foxnews
president has until september to give this aid to ukraine he gets it out on september weeks before the deadline so we give our ally aid and joe biden is not investigated remember that they get the aid and we get nothing in return the democrats
want that to be an impeachable offense good luck with jessebwatters foxnews
about ukraine this about impeachment this is about subverting billoreilly so true and led by angry and dishonest people who hate themselves and must hate our country
a great try by seanspicer we are all proud of you
why is such a focus put on and hand witnesses many of whom are never trumpers or whose lawyers are never trumpers when all you have to do is read the phone call transcript with the ukrainian president and see first hand he and others also stated that there was
put on him to investigate sleepy joe biden even though as president i have an to look into corruption and actions on tape about firing the prosecutor and his taking millions of dollars with no knowledge or talent from a
ukrainian energy company and more millions taken from china and now reports of other companies and countries also giving him big money are certainly looking very corrupt to put it mildly to me both bidens should be forced to testify in this no due process scam
i will be releasing the transcript of the first and therefore more important phone call with the ukrainian president before end
economy is booming seems set to have yet another record day
many of the people in daca no longer very young are far from some are very tough hardened criminals president obama said he had no legal right to sign order but would anyway if supreme court remedies with overturn a deal will be made with dems for them to stay
daca recipients with arrest records that is a very large proportion of the total loudobbs not good but we will be able to make a deal with the dems
ridiculous impeachment is a travesty not an inquiry just read the loudobbs
circus is coming to town the corrupt compromised coward congenital liar adam schiff show on capital hill brought to you by his raging psychotic democrats the top allies in the media mob everything going to see in the next two weeks is rigged
this is a phony showtrial there is zero due process none it is yet another fraudulent hoax conspiracy theory it is another witch hunt this is what the socialist doemocrat party has become not one thing the democrats have done in the past years except try
to hurt donald trump and we the people that support him the left has never accepted the results of the election they never saw this coming this is not just about president trump they hate everyone he is seanhannity foxnews sean the amazing warrior
of americans will see what a partisan sham this whole thing rush limbaugh foxandfriends also why is corrupt politician schiff allowed to hand over cross examination to a high priced outside lawyer did that lawyer ever work for me which would be a conflict
the democrats have stacked the deck against president trump and the republicans they have leaked out everything stevedoocy foxandfriends
pelosi cares more about power than she does about principle she did not want to go down this road she realizes this is a huge loser for democrats the founders envisioned the worst people being in politics yet they envision this you have these people taking
the most powerful tool the legislative branch has impeachment turned it into a political cudgel which is not at all what the founders intended when you hear schiff use all these words like quid pro quo it is because they specify that donald trump broke
any laws or did anything wrong and they have to move away from quid pro quo because there was no quid and there was no quo ukraine got money weeks early and there was no charleshurt foxandfriends
never trumpers

everywhere marie yovanovitch went turned bad she started off in somalia how did that go then fast forward to ukraine where the new ukrainian president spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him it is a us absolute right to appoint ambassadors
they call it at the pleasure of the the us now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy much different than proceeding administrations it is called quite simply america first with all of that however i have done far more for ukraine than o

pelosi and her do nothing democrats drug pricing bill do the trick fewer cures fewer treatments time for the democrats to get serious about bipartisan solutions to lowering prescription drug prices for families
house republicans are showing real leadership and prepared to enact bipartisan solutions for drug prices do nothing democrats are playing partisan politics with your drug prices we are ready to work together if they actually want to get something done

support for impeachment is not there i think the democrats will have to come up with a new game jasoninthehouse foxnews

joe concha the hill emerson college poll impeachment among independents oppose support you see why pelosi is reluctant to go in with this dems have to go home and explain why they done something on opioid crisis drug prices usmca the border etc
democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing the whistleblower the guy who took his case to staff first is what really blows the lid off this entire saga he worked for biden on ukraine policy when biden was vp he worked for deep state henchman john

new york post editorial than pointless all those hours of televised testimony plainly failed on their announced goal to change minds part of the problem is that democrats already leaked the best evidence they had more important not one witness offered
any direct evidence that president trump did anything impeachable no one heard him order a quid pro quo no one offered a convincing reason why interest in having ukraine probe potential cortuption warrants impeachment want no quid pro ambassador
sondland said trump told him none of this will move the needle for anyone and now dems in swing districts head home for thanksgiving to hear from voters pelosi co are putting on a show to appease the democratic base instead of doing the work all americans need

brazil and argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies which is not good for our farmers therefore effective immediately i will restore the tariffs on all steel aluminum that is shipped into the us from those countries the federal

us markets are up as much as since the announcement of tariffs on and the us is taking in massive amounts of money and giving some to our farmers who have been targeted by china
process has been unfair republicans even get their own witnesses it gets me that adam schiff is not punishable for lying in any mariabartiromo
american people are going to see this for what it is it is a political effort by the democrats and the president certainly have to aid in the impeachment robert ray mariabartiromo democrats are getting in their home districts
united states has outperformed the rest of the world in an eye popping fashion i think seen numbers like mohamed elerian allianz chief economic adviser but despite this there is tremendous potential for growth far greater than most have understood

manufacturers are being held back by the strong dollar which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the federal reserve which has called interest rates and quantitative tightening wrong from the first days of jay powell

just landed in the united kingdom heading to london for nato meetings tomorrow prior to landing i read the republicans report on the impeachment hoax great job radical left has no case read the transcripts even be allowed can we go to supreme court to stop
mini mike bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any democrat but to go after president trump only the failing new york times thinks that is ok because their hatred bias is so great they even see straight not ok
the united states of america supports the brave people of iran who are protesting for their freedom we have under the trump administration and always will
enjoyed my meeting with prime minister borisjohnson of the united kingdom at last night talked about numerous subjects including nato and trade
great progress has been made by nato over the last three years countries other than the us have agreed to pay billion dollars more per year and by that number will be billion dollars nato will be richer and stronger than ever before
just finished meetings with turkey and germany heading to a meeting now with those countries that have met their goals followed by meetings with denmark and italy
when meetings are over i will be heading back to washington we be doing a press conference at the close of nato because we did so many over the past two days safe travels to all
the fake news media is doing everything possible to belittle my very successful trip to london for nato i got along great with the nato leaders even getting them to pay billion a year more billion a year more in years no increase for us only deep respect
nato has now recognized space as an operational domain and the alliance is stronger for it us leadership ensures peace through strength and we must continue to show strength and win on all fronts land air sea and space
when i said in my phone call to the president of ukraine would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and ukraine knows a lot about with the word i am referring to the united states our country i then went on to say that
would like to have the attorney general of the united states call you or your this based on what i have seen is their big point and it is no point at a all except for a big win for me the democrats should apologize to the american people
tremendous things achieved for us on my nato trip proudly for our country no president has ever achieved so much in so little time without a us increase other countries have already increased by billionwith billion soon such a thing has never been done before
the do nothing democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the house they have no impeachment case and are demeaning our country but nothing matters to them they have gone crazy therefore i say if you are going to impeach me do it now fast so we can have a fair
trial in the senate and so that our country can get back to business we will have schiff the bidens pelosi and many more testify and will reveal for the first time how corrupt our system really is i was elected to the and what i am doing

president has the authority to investigate corruption the president himself released the transcript of the call now the democrats have no evidence of a crime and no evidence of violating the law this is a kangaroo court in the house but going to go to the senate
going to go nowhere they are going to impeach not because they have the evidence but because they hate the president i think the american people know that this is a waste of time this is democrats putting on a circus sentedcruz interviewed by sleepy eyes chuck todd

american people are supposed to believe that this simply a part of everthing been trying to do for the last three years i think it is really a hard sell for nancy danhenninger the wall street journal
would be the first impeachment in american history without a specific criminal statute or crime that the president whose impeached would have allegedly paul gigot the wall street journal
president in american history has been treated like marklevinshow
democrats have thrown a wrecking ball at our mariabartiromo

i know what report current director of the fbi christopher wray was reading but it sure the one given to me with that kind of attitude he will never be able to fix the fbi which is badly broken despite having some of the greatest men women working there

the wall street journal story on the china deal is completely wrong especially their statement on tariffs fake news they should find a better leaker
we have agreed to a very large phase one deal with china they have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of agricultural product energy and manufactured goods plus much more the tariffs will remain as is with put on much of the remainder
the penalty tariffs set for december will not be charged because of the fact that we made the deal we will begin negotiations on the phase two deal immediately rather than waiting until after the election this is an amazing deal for all thank you
whole process has been rigged from the repdlesko
not fair that being impeached when done absolutely nothing wrong the radical left do nothing democrats have become the party of hate they are so bad for our country

wow a stunning rebuke of the fbi the fisa court severly chastised the fbi for the fisa abuses brought to light in the recent inspector report there were at least significant foxnews statement by the court was long and tough means my case was a scam
democrat despite their denials are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous impeachment if they vote yes it will be much easier for republicans to win in
good marks and reviews on the letter i sent to pelosi today she is the worst no wonder with people like her and chuck schumer dc has been such a mess for so long and that includes the previous administration who and now we know for sure spied on my campaign
so if comey the top people in the fbi were dirty cops and cheated on the fisa court all of these phony cases have to be overturned or dismissed they went after me with the fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary the dnc which they illegally presented to fisa
they want to impeach me not worried and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways how can they do that and yet impeach a very successful economy plus president of the united states who has done nothing wrong these people are crazy
marcthiessen say the democrats are trying to take away their votes pelosi was right the first time impeachment has backfired thoroughly on the democrats how can you impeach the president for going to the
foxandfriends hope is that impeachment will never become this trivial kilmeade well said brian
can you believe that i will be impeached today by the radical left do nothing democrats and i did nothing wrong a terrible thing read the transcripts this should never happen to another president again say a prayer
just wanted to get at the president they had no intention of having a proper investigation they find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of congress which every administration from the beginning has repdougcollins foxandfriends
sad a gentleman who came to the white house and all they had was never to let him have an easy breath all they wanted to do is impeach him they started the day after he was elected even the day after he was sworn in but this president came to washington and
said going to clean up washington going to help he gave big tax cuts made our military strong mad at him because he actually did what he said he was going to do history will record experiencing some of the best times ever
had while the democrats are just looking out for elections this president should just continue to fight like always fought for himself for this country continue to put forth policies like prescription drugs trade policies what makes this president stand
out and been amazing at it the democrsts have no message they have no hope for repdougcollins foxandfriends thank you doug
is all about convicting a president based on innuendo not on the facts even the ukrainian president said there was no repmarkmeadows
is a terrible idea for the country the more people learn about impeachment the less people want tuckercarlson
evidence has to be overwhelming and it is not not even ken starr former independent counsel
in the end here nothing happened we approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a president should be removed from office i believe that a president be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the senate
convict and remove the president then the house should not be impeaching the president in the first place if this is the new standard every president from here on out is andy mccarthy foxnews so well stated thank you
such atrocious lies by the radical left do nothing democrats this is an assault on america and an assault on the republican party

republican vote what people are talking about the republicans are united like never before
senate shall set the time and place of the if the do nothing democrats decide in their great wisdom not to show up they would lose by default
presidential harassment
i got impeached last night without one republican vote being cast with the do nothing dems on their continuation of the greatest witch hunt in american history now the do nothing party want to do nothing with the articles not deliver them to the senate but call
pelosi feels her phony impeachment hoax is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the senate which can set a date and put this whole scam into default if they refuse to show up the do nothings are so bad for our country
watters this is the best year any president has ever had plus we get an greggutfeld the five foxnews
the great usmca trade deal mexico canada has been sitting on nancy desk for months she even know what it says today after passing by a wide margin in the house pelosi tried to take credit for it labor will vote for trump trade deal is great for usa
so after the democrats gave me no due process in the house no lawyers no witnesses no nothing they now want to tell the senate how to run their trial actually they have zero proof of anything they will never even show up they want out i want an immediate trial
the house democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the republicans on their impeachment hoax the republicans have never been so united the case is so bad that they even want to go to trial
the reason the democrats want to submit the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they want corrupt politician adam shifty schiff to testify under oath nor do they want the whistleblower the missing second whistleblower the informer the bidens to testify
is political malpractice this is a horrible judgement call on the part of the speaker you put your members in trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot only going to extend it out further this looks like the joke that it actually ben domenech
been revealed is a country in better shape than been in decades working men and women in the country are the beneficiaries of a president doing exactly what he said he was going to do that is to restore prosperity for all loudobbs thank you lou

crazy nancy wants to dictate terms on the impeachment hoax to the republican majority senate but striped away all due process no lawyers or witnesses on the democrat majority house the dems just wish it would all end their case is dead their poll numbers are horrendous
the democrats and crooked hillary paid for provided a fake dossier with phony information gotten from foreign sources pushed it to the corrupt media dirty cops have now been caught they spied on my campaign then tried to cover it up just like watergate but bigger
pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the us congress and now she is crying for fairness in the senate and breaking all rules while doing so she lost congress once she will do it again
nancy pelosi who has already lost the house speakership once is about to lose it again is doing everything she can to delay the zero republican vote articles of impeachment she is trying to take over the senate chuck is trying to take over the trial no way
what right does crazy nancy have to hold up this senate trial none she has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision this witch hunt must end now with a trial in the senate or let her default lose no more time should be wasted on this impeachment scam
it be reasonable to assume that republicans in the senate should handle the impeachment hoax in the exact same manner as democrats in the house handled their recent partisan scam why would it be different for republicans than it was for the radical left democrats

alienating independents this president is being persecuted over three years with one investigation after another and that really plays to his foxnews cvpayne their partisan witch hunt is hurting our country do badly only bringing more division than ever
a lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of dirty filthy cops politicians government officials and an investigation that was illegally started that spied on my campaign the witch hunt is sputtering badly but still going on ukraine hoax if this
had happened to a presidential candidate or president who was a democrat everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason and more and it would be considered the crime of the century far bigger and more sinister than watergate

iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation
general qassem soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many morebut got caught he was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number
of protesters killed in iran itself while iran will never be able to properly admit it soleimani was both hated and feared within the country they are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe he should have been taken out many years ago
the united states has paid iraq billions of dollars a year for many years that is on top of all else we have done for them the people of iraq want to be dominated controlled by iran but ultimately that is their choice over the last years iran has gained more
and more control over iraq and the people of iraq are not happy with that it will never end well
christopher bedford the federalist senior editor is nothing new in these emails at all been discovered exactly what we knew before which is that the white house political figures wanted to cut off aid trump wanted to question aid to a number of
different places that he thought were wasteful and the career staff as they always do pushed back and made a million excuses as to why they could not possibly stop spending us taxpayer money there was a back forth over the legal arguments the wh decision was
followed and then it was withdrawn the democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks as senator josh hawley just said going to enter a motion to dismiss the impeachment trial because never actually been brought to

approval rating in the republican party thank you

iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain usa assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an american badly wounded many others not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime including recently
hundreds of iranian protesters he was already attacking our embassy and preparing for additional hits in other locations iran has been nothing but problems for many years let this serve as a warning that if iran strikes any americans or american assets we have
targeted iranian sites representing the american hostages taken by iran many years ago some at a very high level important to iran the iranian culture and those targets and iran itself will be hit very fast and very hard the usa wants no more threats
the united states just spent two trillion dollars on military equipment we are the biggest and by far the best in the world if iran attacks an american base or any american we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their wayand without hesitation
these media posts will serve as notification to the united states congress that should iran strike any us person or target the united states will quickly fully strike back perhaps in a disproportionate manner such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless
reason they are not sending the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they are so weak and so lindseygrahamsc mariabartiromo the great scam continues to be spending time on this political hoax at this moment in our history when i am so busy is sad
the impeachment hoax just a continuation of the witch hunt which started even before i won the election must end quickly read the transcripts see the ukrainian strong statement no pressure get this done it is a con game by the dems to help with the election

word is that mini mike bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates that he is thinking about dropping out of the democrat primary the fact is he was not true to himself and the public was able to quickly figure him out not a good experience for mini mike
positive cnn is infected with trump derangement syndrome calling out cnn for irresponsibly politicizing what should be a unifying battle against a virus that choose trishregan foxnews like i say they are fake news
so the coronavirus which started in china and spread to various countries throughout the world but very slowly in the us because president trump closed our border and ended flights very early is now being blamed by the do nothing democrats to be the fault of
the do nothing democrats were busy wasting time on the immigration hoax anything else they could do to make the republican party look bad while i was busy calling early border flight closings putting us way ahead in our battle with coronavirus dems called it very wrong

go around pennsylvania and you see trump signs everywhere the donald trump situation is bigger than the reagan revolution donald trump has inspired
mini mike is getting slammed his debates were perhaps the worst in presidential debating history a total phony who disavowed after swearing by it for years and even recently he horribly overused it then dropped when running as a dem a total phony
the dems are working hard to take the prized nomination away from bernie back room politics which bernie is not very good at his people will not let it happen again
i am pleased to announce the nomination of repratcliffe congressman john ratcliffe to be director of national intelligence dni would have completed process earlier but john wanted to wait until after ig report was finished john is an outstanding man of great talent

sleepy joe victory in the south carolina democrat primary should be the end of mini mike joke of a campaign after the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates mini mike now has biden split up his very few voters taking many away

congratulations to sleepy joe biden
tom steyer who other than mini mike bloomberg spent more dollars for nothing than any candidate in history quit the race today proclaiming how thrilled he was to be a part of the the democrat clown show go away tom and save whatever little money you have left

mini mike consultants and socalled did that advice work out ask are on the and all making a fortune for themselves pushing mini hard when they knew he never had what it takes pay them anymore mike they led you down

as usual jay powell and the federal reserve are slow to act germany and others are pumping money into their economies other central banks are much more aggressive the us should have for all of the right reasons the lowest rate we putting us at a
competitive disadvantage we should be leading not following
foxnews is working hard pushing the radical left do nothing democrats they want to be unlike their competitors cnn msdnc comcast fair balanced when will they ever learn the radical left never even gave foxnews permission to partake in their low rated debates
the only people in favor of mini mike continuing with his hapless campaign are me and his political consultants who are getting richer and richer by the day
they are staging a coup against bernie
departing for the great state of north carolinapictwittercombjnytnnhut
this is an incredible time for our are in the midst of the great american comeback jobs are booming incomes are soaring poverty is plummeting confidence is surging and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the us military promises made promises

the democrats in the house should propose a very simple one year payroll tax cut great for the middle class great for the usa
wow sleepy joe know where he is or what doing honestly i think he even knows what office hes running
central bank cut interest rates and stated it will most likely further ease in order to make up for coronavirus situation and slowdown they reduced to a record low other countries are doing the same thing if not more so our federal reserve has us
paying higher rates than many others when we should be paying less tough on our exporters and puts the usa at a competitive disadvantage must be the other way around should ease and cut rate big jerome powell led federal reserve has called it wrong from day one sad

the biggest loser tonight by far is mini mike bloomberg his consultants took him for a ride million washed down the drain and he got nothing for it but the nickname mini mike and the complete destruction of his reputation way to go mike
elizabeth warren other than mini mike was the loser of the night she even come close to winning her home state of massachusetts well now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer
the democrat establishment came together and crushed bernie sanders again even the fact that elizabeth warren stayed in the race was devastating to bernie and allowed sleepy joe to unthinkably win massachusetts it was a perfect storm with many good states remaining for joe
so selfish for elizabeth warren to stay in the race she has zero chance of even coming close to winning but hurts bernie badly so much for their wonderful liberal friendship will he ever speak to her again she cost him massachusetts and came in third he
make america great again and then keep america great

thank you
we have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the white house for our attack on coronavirus we moved very early to close borders to certain areas which was a godsend vp is doing a great job the fake news media is doing everything possible to make us look bad sad
the new york times is an embarrassment to journalism they were a dead paper before i went into politics and they will be a dead paper after i leave which will be in years fake news is the enemy of the people
the fake news media and their partner the democrat party is doing everything within its semiconsiderable power it used to be greater to inflame the coronavirus situation far beyond what the facts would warrant surgeon general risk is low to the average
chuck schumer said will pay the price for this you know what hit that is far beyond simple rhetoric that is a physical threat or at least a threat that you better vote for trouble ahead
elizabeth warren singlehandedly destroyed the bernie sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on super t he lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out days earlier the dnc is doing it to bernie again will he ever get angry
now the democrats are trying to smear bernie with russia russia russia they are driving him crazy
has outmastered the deep state light years ahead of msdnc i disagree we have a long way to go there are still some very bad sick people in our government people who do not love our country in fact they hate our country

hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both republicans and democrats and please remember very important for all countries businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the restriction on travel from europe the restriction stops people not goods

sleepy joe biden was in charge of the swine flu epidemic which killed thousands of people the response was one of the worst on record our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings a approval rating the highest on record his was lowest
obama white house had to immediately issue an apology for joe remarks and any alarm that he might have caused an alarm about a swine flu outbreak that took months for president obama to declare a national emergency and that killed loudobbs
for decades the cdcgov looked at and studied its testing system but did nothing about it it would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic but a pandemic would never happen they hoped president obama made changes that only complicated things further
their response to swine flu was a full scale disaster with thousands dying and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem until now the changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis all red tape has been cut ready to go
if you want to get money into the hands of people quickly efficiently let them have the full money that they earned approve a payroll tax cut until the end of the year december then you are doing something that is really meaningful only that will make a big difference
the federal reserve must finally lower the fed rate to something comparable to their competitor central banks jay powell and group are putting us at a decided economic physiological disadvantage should never have been this way also stimulate
to this point and because we have had a very strong border policy we have had deaths related to coronavirus if we had weak or open borders that number would be many times higher

believe they are not going after schumer for the threats he made to our cherished united states supreme court and our two great justices if a republican did that there would be an endless price to pay pathetic
so now it is reported that after destroying his life the life of his wonderful family and many others also the fbi working in conjunction with the justice department has the records of general michael flynn how convenient i am strongly considering a full pardon
the individual governors of states and local officials must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights working in conjunction with cdcgov and the federal government
i must say that was a very boring debate biden lied when he said i want to cut social security and medicare what they all said years ago and nothing happened in fact i saved social security and medicare i will not be cutting but they will be careful

i watch and listen to the fake news cnn msdnc abc nbc cbs some of fox desperately foolishly pleading to be politically correct the nytimes the washingtonpost and all i see is hatred of me at any cost they understand that they are destroying themselves
we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself at the end of the day period we will make a decision as to which way we want to go
we will be guided by the wishes of prime minister abe of japan a great friend of the united states and a man who has done a magnificent job on the olympic venue as to attending the olympic games in japan he will make the proper decision

the new york times changed headlines times in order to satisfy the radical left what should have been a good story got until the headline alone made it very unfair fake corrupt news that is very dangerous for our country
it is very important that we totally protect our asian american community in the united states and all around the world they are amazing people and the spreading of the virus
is not their fault in any way shape or form they are working closely with us to get rid of it we will prevail together

this is the way the nytimes finished a story on me can see the contrast between the steady assured informed and strong leadership that vp biden sleepy joe has shown and the bungling chaotic and dishonest startstop approach that mr not pres trump has shown
us since the beginning of this they meant the opposite forgot to mention that i closed our country to china and europe very early long before it was considered acceptable to do so sleepy joe said i was but i saved thousands of lives fake news
republicans had a deal until nancy pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation the democrats want the virus to win they are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies they want open borders green new deal republicans agree

the defense production act is in full force but had to use it because no one has said no millions of masks coming as back up to states
this is not about the ridiculous green new deal it is about putting our great workers and companies back to work
congress must approve the deal without all of the nonsense today the longer it takes the harder it will be to start up our economy our workers will be hurt
our people want to return to work they will practice social distancing and all else and seniors will be watched over protectively lovingly we can do two things together the cure cannot be worse by far than the problem congress must act now we will come back strong

so much of the lamestream media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong they are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist these are very dangerous corrupt people who will do anything to win name your sources
one of the reasons that fake news has become so prevalent far reaching is the fact that corrupt base their stories on sources that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story when you see sources believe the story it is
very often fake news lamestream media should be forced to reveal sources very much as they did in the long ago past if they did that the media would be trusted again and fake news would largely be a thing of the past
